A catalog pair is a feature on GeM that allows Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to create a paired catalog for their spare parts with the catalog of their authorized dealers or system integrators. This pairing ensures that the original OEM products are sold through authorized channels, thus maintaining the quality and authenticity of the products.

**Benefits of Catalog Pair:**

* **Increases visibility:** The catalog pair feature increases the visibility of both the OEM and their authorized dealers on GeM, making it easier for buyers to find genuine products and reliable suppliers.
* **Streamlines procurement:** The paired catalog simplifies the procurement process for buyers as they can directly purchase genuine OEM parts from authorized dealers without having to search for multiple suppliers.

**Discontinuation Option:**

The discontinue option on GeM allows OEMs to discontinue their products from being sold on GeM. This option is useful when an OEM is discontinuing a particular product or model. By discontinuing the product, the OEM can prevent further sales of the product and ensure that buyers are aware of the discontinuation.

**Benefits of Discontinuation Option:**

* **Prevents further sales:** By discontinuing a product, the OEM can prevent further sales of the product on GeM, ensuring that buyers are not purchasing outdated or discontinued products.
* **Manages product lifecycle:** The discontinuation option allows OEMs to effectively manage their product lifecycle by removing obsolete or discontinued products from GeM, making way for newer and updated products.
