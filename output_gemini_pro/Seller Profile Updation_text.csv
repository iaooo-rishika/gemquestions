"What is the purpose of the email verification step during profile setup?
","The purpose of the email verification step during profile setup is to:

1. **Verify your identity:** By requiring you to provide a valid email address during profile setup, GeM can authenticate your identity and ensure that you are a legitimate user. This helps to prevent fraudulent or malicious activity on the platform.

2. **Prevent duplicate accounts:** The email verification step also helps to prevent users from creating multiple accounts. When you provide your email address, GeM checks its database to see if there is already an account associated with that email address. If there is, you will be prompted to log in to your existing account instead of creating a new one.

3. **Secure your account:** Email verification is a security measure that helps to protect your GeM account. By requiring you to provide a valid email address, GeM can send you important notifications and security alerts related to your account. For example, if someone tries to access your account from an unrecognized device or location, GeM may send you an email notification to alert you of the suspicious activity.

4. **Enable password reset:** If you ever forget your password, the email verification step allows you to reset it. When you request a password reset, GeM will send a link to your email address. You can click on the link to create a new password for your account."
