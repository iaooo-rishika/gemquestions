"I already have certifications from BIS/ISO/etc. Do I still need to go through the VA process?
","Yes, even if you already possess certifications from recognized organizations like BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) or ISO (International Organization for Standardization), you still need to complete the Verified Assessment (VA) process on the GeM portal. Here are a few reasons why: 

1. VA Provides Consistency: The VA process on GeM ensures a standardized assessment of suppliers across the board. It evaluates various aspects of your business, including technical capabilities, financial stability, and quality management systems. This ensures a level playing field for all suppliers and helps create a transparent and efficient procurement ecosystem.

2. Compliance with Guidelines: The GeM portal is an e-marketplace created by the Government of India, and it has specific guidelines and regulations that all suppliers must adhere to. These regulations are in place to maintain quality and ensure fair business practices. The VA process helps determine if your organization meets the necessary criteria set by the government. 

3. Access to a Wider Market: By successfully completing the VA process and becoming a verified supplier on GeM, you open up opportunities to participate in numerous government tenders and procurements. This gives you access to a vast market and the potential for increased business growth.

4. Credibility and Trust: The VA certification from GeM adds credibility and trust to your organization. It demonstrates your commitment to quality, standards, and ethical business practices. This can be a valuable asset in attracting potential customers and building long-term relationships.

5. Continuous Improvement: The VA process is not just a one-time assessment; it also serves as a platform for continuous improvement. GeM encourages suppliers to strive for excellence by providing feedback, suggesting areas for improvement, and helping them implement best practices. This ongoing evaluation helps you maintain high standards and stay competitive.

Remember that having certifications from BIS, ISO, or other recognized bodies is a positive step towards demonstrating your quality and standards. However, the VA process on the GeM portal is specifically designed to assess your suitability as a supplier for government procurements. Completing the VA process ensures compliance, expands your market reach, and enhances your credibility in the e-marketplace."
