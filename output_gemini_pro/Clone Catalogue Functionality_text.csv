"What is the Clone Catalogue functionality on GeM and how does it work?
","The Clone Catalogue functionality on GeM allows users to quickly and easily create a new catalogue by replicating an existing one. This can save a significant amount of time and effort, especially when creating multiple catalogues with similar products and services.

Here's how the Clone Catalogue functionality works:

1. **Identify the Source Catalogue:**
   - Select the existing catalogue that you want to clone. This catalogue should contain the products and services that you want to include in the new catalogue.


2. **Click on the 'Clone' Button:**
   - Once you have selected the source catalogue, click on the 'Clone' button. This button is usually located at the top of the catalogue page.


3. **Select the New Catalogue Type:**
   - In the pop-up window that appears, select the type of the new catalogue that you want to create. You can choose from the following options:
     - Dynamic Catalogue: This type of catalogue is automatically updated with the latest products and services from the selected source catalogue.
     - Static Catalogue: This type of catalogue is a snapshot of the products and services from the selected source catalogue at the time of cloning.


4. **Enter the Catalogue Details:**
   - Provide a name and description for the new catalogue. You can also select the category and sub-category for the catalogue.


5. **Click on the 'Clone' Button:**
   - Once you have entered all the necessary details, click on the 'Clone' button to create the new catalogue.

The cloning process may take a few minutes, depending on the size of the source catalogue. Once the process is complete, you will be able to view the new catalogue in your GeM account.

Key Points to Remember:

- You can clone both dynamic and static catalogues.
- When cloning a dynamic catalogue, the new catalogue will be automatically updated with the latest products and services from the source catalogue.
- When cloning a static catalogue, the new catalogue will be a snapshot of the products and services from the source catalogue at the time of cloning.
- You can create multiple catalogues by cloning an existing catalogue.
- Cloning a catalogue is a quick and easy way to create a new catalogue with similar products and services."

- You want to create a new catalog that is based on the structure of an existing catalog, but with different items and prices.
- You want to create a new catalog that is based on the items and prices of an existing catalog, but with a different structure."
"Can I clone catalogs across different product categories or only within the same category?
","You can clone catalogs across different product categories.

The cloned catalog will inherit the properties and settings of the original catalog, including the product categories, products, and suppliers. You can then modify the cloned catalog to adapt it to the specific needs of the new product category.

Cloning catalogs across different product categories can be useful for creating new catalogs quickly and easily, or for transferring products from one category to another."
"Is there a limit to how many times I can clone an existing catalog?
","Yes, there is a limit to how many times you can clone an existing catalog. The limit is 10 clones per catalog. This limit is in place to help ensure that the GeM platform remains performant and scalable. If you need to create more than 10 clones of a catalog, you can contact GeM support for assistance."
"Will cloning a catalog copy over all specifications or are some excluded?
","Yes, cloning a catalog will copy over all specifications, including product attributes, images, and approvals. This ensures that the cloned catalog contains all the necessary information for buyers to make informed purchasing decisions.

However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. Custom fields and attachments are not copied over during the cloning process. This is because custom fields are specific to the original catalog and attachments are typically large files that can slow down the cloning process.

If you need to include custom fields and attachments in the cloned catalog, you will need to do so manually after the cloning process is complete.

Here is a summary of what is and is not copied over when you clone a catalog:

**Copied over:**

* Product attributes
* Images
* Approvals
* Suppliers
* Prices

**Not copied over:**

* Custom fields
* Attachments
* Purchase orders
* Contracts
* Invoices"
"What happens if I try to publish a cloned catalog without making any changes to specifications?
","If you try to publish a cloned catalog without making any changes to the specifications, the system will reject it. 

The cloned catalog must be edited and have at least one change in specifications before it can be published. This is because the cloned catalog is considered a new catalog, and it must have its own unique set of specifications.

To make changes to the specifications of a cloned catalog, you can:

* Add new products or services
* Edit the existing products or services
* Change the prices of the products or services
* Add or remove images of the products or services
* Change the descriptions of the products or services

Once you have made at least one change to the specifications of the cloned catalog, you can publish it."

In general, it should not take more than a few hours to clone and publish a new catalog. If the catalog is large or complex, it may take longer. You can contact GeM customer support for more information or assistance."
"If I clone a catalog and make changes, will it affect the original catalog at all or are they separate?
","No, cloning a catalog and making changes to the cloned catalog will not affect the original catalog in any way. The cloned catalog is a completely separate entity from the original catalog. Any changes you make to the cloned catalog, such as adding or removing items, will not be reflected in the original catalog. Similarly, any changes you make to the original catalog will not be reflected in the cloned catalog.

Cloning a catalog can be a useful way to create a new catalog that is based on an existing catalog, but with some modifications. For example, you might clone a catalog and then make changes to the item descriptions or prices. Alternatively, you might clone a catalog and then remove some of the items. Once you have made the desired changes to the cloned catalog, you can then publish it and make it available to your users."
"When I publish a cloned catalog, will it completely replace the existing catalog or be published as a separate new catalog?
","When you publish a cloned catalog, it will be published as a separate new catalog. It will not replace the existing catalog.

This means that any changes you make to the cloned catalog will not affect the original catalog. Additionally, any items that you add to the cloned catalog will not be added to the original catalog.

This feature can be useful if you want to create a new catalog that is based on an existing catalog, but you want to make changes to the new catalog without affecting the original catalog."

| Origin | Description |
|---|---|
| Manual | The catalog was created manually. |
| Clone | The catalog was cloned from another catalog. |

You can also use the GeM API to retrieve the origin of a catalog. The following API call will return the origin of the catalog with the specified ID:

```
GET /api/v1/catalogs/{catalog_id}
```

The response from the API call will include a field called ""origin"" that will indicate whether the catalog was created manually or cloned from another catalog."
Is cloning catalogs recommended as a standard practice or only in certain situations?,"Cloning catalogs is recommended as a standard practice for various reasons:

1. **Backup and Recovery:** Cloning catalogs serves as a backup mechanism, allowing you to maintain an identical copy of your catalog. This copy can be utilized for recovery purposes in case the original catalog becomes corrupted or inaccessible due to technical issues, human error, or other unforeseen events. By having a cloned catalog, you can quickly restore your data and minimize downtime.

2. **Parallel Processing:** Cloning catalogs enables parallel processing of large datasets. By creating multiple clones, you can distribute processing tasks across different machines or cloud instances, significantly reducing the overall processing time. This approach is particularly beneficial for complex or resource-intensive operations, such as data analysis, machine learning model training, or large-scale simulations.

3. **Data Isolation:** Cloning catalogs provides a means of data isolation, especially in situations where multiple users or applications need to access and modify data independently. By creating separate clones for different users or applications, you can ensure that changes made by one party do not affect the data integrity or consistency for others. This isolation helps prevent data conflicts and maintains the integrity of the original catalog.

4. **Testing and Development:** Cloning catalogs facilitates testing and development activities. You can create a clone to test new features, apply updates, or validate changes without affecting the live catalog. This approach allows developers and administrators to experiment with changes in a controlled environment, identify potential issues, and ensure that the changes function properly before implementing them in the production environment.

5. **Collaboration and Sharing:** Cloning catalogs enables collaboration and data sharing among team members, departments, or organizations. By creating and sharing cloned catalogs, users can access and work on the same data simultaneously without modifying the original catalog. This facilitates collaborative projects, streamlines workflows, and promotes knowledge sharing.

While cloning catalogs is generally recommended as a standard practice, there may be situations where it is not necessary or suitable. For example, if you have a small and static catalog that is infrequently accessed or modified, cloning may not provide significant benefits. Additionally, if storage space or computational resources are limited, the overhead associated with maintaining multiple clones may outweigh the advantages.

In summary, cloning catalogs is a recommended standard practice for data protection, parallel processing, data isolation, testing and development, and collaboration. However, it is essential to consider your specific data and usage requirements to determine whether cloning is necessary and beneficial for your organization."
