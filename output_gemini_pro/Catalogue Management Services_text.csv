"How soon after adding a new service can buyers start purchasing it on GeM? Is there a review period?
","Sure, here is the answer to your question:

**How soon after adding a new service can buyers start purchasing it on GeM? Is there a review period?**

Once a new service is added to GeM, it typically undergoes a review period before buyers can start purchasing it. The review period can vary depending on the complexity of the service and the number of stakeholders involved. In general, the review period can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

During the review period, GeM will conduct a thorough evaluation of the service to ensure that it meets all the necessary requirements. This includes checking for compliance with relevant laws and regulations, verifying the quality and reliability of the service, and assessing the pricing. GeM may also consult with relevant stakeholders, such as industry experts and government agencies, to gather feedback and ensure that the service is suitable for procurement.

Once the review period is complete, GeM will publish a notification on its website informing buyers that the new service is available for purchase. Buyers can then start placing orders for the service through the GeM portal.

It's important to note that, in some cases, certain services may require additional approvals or clearances before they can be purchased on GeM. These approvals may come from government agencies, regulatory bodies, or other relevant authorities. In such cases, the review period may be extended until all the necessary approvals are obtained.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact GeM customer support."
