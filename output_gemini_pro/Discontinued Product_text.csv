"If I am a reseller and the OEM discontinues a product catalog, will my catalog also get discontinued automatically?
","No, your catalog will not be discontinued automatically if the OEM discontinues a product catalog. As a reseller, you have the option to continue selling products from that catalog until your stock is depleted. However, you will not be able to replenish your stock once it runs out. Additionally, you may want to consider removing the discontinued products from your catalog to avoid customer confusion.

Here are a few things you can do if the OEM discontinues a product catalog:

* Contact the OEM to inquire about alternative products that you can sell.
* Update your catalog to reflect the discontinued products.
* Offer discounts on the discontinued products to clear out your stock.
* Consider selling other products from the same OEM or from different OEMs.
* Communicate with your customers about the discontinuation of the products and offer them alternative options."
"If I am in a Q3 category, when I discontinue a product catalog, will it affect the listings of other paired sellers?
","No, discontinuing a product catalog by a Q3 seller will not affect the listings of other paired sellers.

Q3 sellers have individual product catalogs and are not linked to other sellers' catalogs. Therefore, discontinuing a product catalog by a Q3 seller will only affect the seller's own product listings. Other paired sellers' product listings will remain unaffected."
"If I am a reseller and the OEM discontinues a product, will it show as discontinued in my seller dashboard?
","Yes, if you are a reseller and the OEM discontinues a product, it will show as discontinued in your seller dashboard. GeM takes proactive steps to ensure that discontinued products are promptly identified and marked as such in the system. This helps maintain transparency and accuracy in the marketplace and prevents confusion or inconvenience for resellers and buyers alike.

Here's how the process works:

1. When an OEM discontinues a product, they typically notify GeM or the relevant authorities.

2. GeM verifies the discontinuation status of the product through official sources or by contacting the OEM directly.

3. Once the discontinuation is confirmed, GeM updates the product information in the system and marks it as ""discontinued.""

4. The discontinued product will no longer be visible to buyers in the search results or product listings.

5. Resellers who have the discontinued product listed in their seller dashboard will see the ""discontinued"" status clearly indicated.

6. Resellers can take appropriate actions, such as removing the discontinued product from their offerings or exploring alternative products from other OEMs.

By promptly updating the discontinuation status, GeM helps resellers stay informed about product availability and avoid potential issues related to discontinued items. Resellers can regularly check their seller dashboard to monitor any changes in product status and adjust their offerings accordingly."

"I'm a reseller who carries products from multiple OEMs. If one OEM discontinues a product, does that affect the same product I source from another OEM?
","As a GeM customer service, I understand your concern about the potential impact of a product discontinuation by one OEM on the same product sourced from another OEM. Here's how it affects you as a reseller who carries products from multiple OEMs:

**Product Availability:**
 - **Discontinued Product:**
   - If an OEM discontinues a product, it means they will no longer manufacture or supply that particular product. This affects the availability of the product in the market.
   - The discontinued product from the original OEM will no longer be accessible through the GeM portal.
 - **Alternate OEM:**
   - You may still be able to source the same product from other OEMs who continue to manufacture and supply it.
   - However, availability may vary depending on the demand and production capacity of the alternate OEMs.

**Price and Quality:**
 - **Price:**
   - The discontinuation of a product by one OEM can affect the pricing of the same product sourced from other OEMs.
   - Due to the reduced availability, the demand for the remaining stock may increase, potentially leading to higher prices.
 - **Quality:**
   - If the discontinued product had unique features or specifications, it may be challenging to find an exact replacement from another OEM.
   - The alternate OEMs may offer similar products with different features, quality, and performance.

**Customer Satisfaction:**
 - **Brand Loyalty:**
   - Customers who prefer a specific OEM or product may be disappointed if the product is discontinued.
   - This can impact customer satisfaction and loyalty towards your business.
 - **Trust and Reputation:**
   - If you are unable to provide the discontinued product or a suitable alternative, it may affect the trust and reputation of your business.

**Recommendations:**

   - Maintain open communication with the OEMs you source products from.

 - **Diversify Your Product Portfolio:**

Overall, the discontinuation of a product by one OEM can have an impact on your business as a reseller who carries products from multiple OEMs. It's essential to stay informed, communicate effectively with customers and OEMs, and adapt your product portfolio to mitigate the potential consequences."
"Are there any fees or penalties for frequently discontinuing and relisting product catalogs as an OEM?
","As a GeM customer service, I can inform you that there are no fees or penalties for frequently discontinuing and relisting product catalogs as an OEM. 

OEMs are free to discontinue and relist their product catalogs as per their business needs. However, it's important to keep in mind that discontinuing and relisting product catalogs frequently may impact the visibility and ranking of your products on the GeM platform.

To ensure a consistent presence and maintain good visibility for your products, it's advisable to avoid discontinuing and relisting catalogs frequently. Instead, consider updating your existing catalogs regularly with new products and offerings. This will help you maintain a strong presence on the platform and attract more potential buyers."

","As a reseller on GeM, you will receive notifications if an OEM discontinues a product you are carrying. This will allow you to update your listings accordingly. The notification will be sent to the email address you have registered with GeM.

"When a product gets discontinued, is there a way for buyers to still view the old product page for reference or is it deleted?

"For how long do discontinued product catalogs remain in my seller dashboard before being removed entirely?
","Discontinued product catalogs remain in your seller dashboard for 12 months from the date they are discontinued. After that, they are removed entirely."
"If I discontinue a product as OEM, could another seller apply and list the same discontinued SKU again?
","Yes, another seller can apply and list the same discontinued SKU again on GeM, if you discontinue it as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Here's what happens when you discontinue a product as an OEM on GeM:

1. Your Existing Listings: When you discontinue a product, your existing listings for that product will remain active on GeM for a period of time. This is to ensure that buyers who have already placed orders for the product can still receive their orders. However, you will not be able to accept any new orders for the discontinued product during this period.

2. Removal of Listings: After a certain period of time, your listings for the discontinued product will be removed from GeM. This means that the product will no longer be available for purchase on the platform.

3. New Sellers: Once your listings for the discontinued product are removed, other sellers are eligible to apply and list the same SKU again on GeM. They will need to go through the regular process of product registration and approval to get their listings approved.

4. Product Specifications: It's important to note that the product specifications and quality standards for the discontinued product may vary when another seller lists it again. The new seller will be responsible for ensuring that the product they are selling meets the required specifications and standards.

5. Buyer Awareness: Buyers should be aware that if they are looking to purchase a discontinued product, they may need to check with the new seller to confirm the product's specifications and quality. They should also consider any reviews or feedback from other buyers who have purchased the product from the new seller.

Overall, the discontinuation of a product by one OEM does not prevent other sellers from listing the same discontinued SKU on GeM. However, buyers should be aware of the potential differences in product specifications and quality when purchasing discontinued products from new sellers."
Is there a limit to how many times I can discontinue and relist a product catalog within a certain time period?,"As a GeM customer service, I would like to inform you that there is no limit to how many times you can discontinue and relist a product catalog within a certain time period. However, it's important to note that frequent discontinuation and relisting of products may affect your catalog's visibility and ranking on the GeM portal.

Here are some points to keep in mind when discontinuing and relisting products:

1. Relevancy and Search Ranking: Discontinuing and relisting products frequently can disrupt the relevancy of your catalog in search results. When a product is discontinued, it is removed from search results, and when it is relisted, it takes time to establish its ranking again.

2. Buyer Trust and Experience: Frequent discontinuation and relisting may create confusion and inconvenience for buyers. They may lose trust in your catalog, affecting your sales and overall reputation.

3. Product Visibility and Discoverability: Discontinuing products can reduce their visibility on the GeM portal. Buyers can no longer find the products in search results or through browsing categories. This can impact your sales and lead generation efforts.

4. Catalog Management and Data Integrity: Frequent discontinuation and relisting require continuous catalog updates and data management. This can increase the likelihood of errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in your catalog, potentially affecting your overall business operations.

5. Compliance and Regulations: Certain regulations and guidelines may apply to product discontinuation and relisting. You should ensure that you comply with all applicable rules and regulations when managing your product catalog on GeM.

While there is no specific limit on discontinuation and relisting, it's recommended to consider these factors and maintain a consistent and reliable catalog management approach to ensure the best possible experience for buyers and the overall success of your business on GeM."
