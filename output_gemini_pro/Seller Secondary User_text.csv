"What is GeM and how does it work?
","**What is GeM?**

Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is a one-stop portal to facilitate online procurement of common use goods and services required by various government departments, organizations, and public sector undertakings. GeM is a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platform that aims to transform the way government entities procure goods and services.

**How does GeM work?**

GeM works on a simple and user-friendly interface that allows buyers and sellers to connect and transact seamlessly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how GeM works:

1. **Registration:**
   - Buyers (government departments, organizations, PSUs) and sellers (suppliers, service providers) need to register on the GeM portal.
   - Buyers must provide their organization details, GSTIN, bank account information, and authorized signatories.
   - Sellers must provide their business details, GSTIN, PAN, bank account information, and product/service catalog.

2. **Product/Service Listing:**
   - Sellers can list their products or services on the GeM portal along with their specifications, pricing, and delivery terms.
   - Buyers can browse through the listed products and services and select the ones that meet their requirements.

3. **Bid Submission:**
   - Buyers can create bid invitations for their procurement needs and specify the bid submission deadline.
   - Sellers can submit their bids as per the buyer's requirements and specifications.

4. **Bid Evaluation:**
   - Buyers evaluate the bids based on pre-defined criteria such as price, quality, technical specifications, and delivery terms.
   - Buyers may also conduct reverse auctions to get the best possible price for their procurement.

5. **Order Placement:**
   - Once the bid evaluation is complete, the buyer selects the winning seller and places an order.
   - The seller acknowledges the order and confirms the delivery timeline.

6. **Payment and Delivery:**
   - Buyers make the payment to the seller through the GeM portal using various payment options such as net banking, UPI, or credit/debit cards.
   - Sellers ship the ordered products or provide the services as per the agreed-upon delivery timeline.

7. **Invoice Submission:**
   - After the delivery of products or services, sellers submit invoices to the buyers through the GeM portal.
   - Buyers verify the invoices and release the payment to the sellers.

8. **Dispute Resolution:**
   - In case of any disputes or issues related to the procurement process, buyers and sellers can raise a dispute on the GeM portal.
   - GeM has a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism to address and resolve disputes between buyers and sellers.

By leveraging GeM, government entities can streamline their procurement processes, ensure transparency, and achieve cost savings. Additionally, sellers can gain access to a wider market and increase their sales opportunities."

"Why does the secondary user need to register with PAN or Aadhar based on what I registered with?
","There are a few reasons why the secondary user needs to register with PAN or Aadhar based on what you registered with:

1. To ensure compliance with government regulations: The Government of India mandates that all users who transact on the GeM portal must be registered with their PAN or Aadhar. This is to ensure transparency and accountability in public procurement.

2. For secure and efficient processing of payments: By using the same PAN or Aadhar number as the primary user, the secondary user can ensure that payments are processed quickly and securely. This is because the payment gateway is linked to the PAN or Aadhar number, which helps in verifying the user's identity and ensuring that the funds are transferred to the correct account.

3. To facilitate seamless collaboration and communication: By registering with the same PAN or Aadhar number as the primary user, the secondary user can easily collaborate with the primary user and other authorised personnel within the organisation. This is because they will have access to the same information and can communicate with each other through the GeM portal's messaging system.

4. To maintain a single point of contact: By having all users registered with the same PAN or Aadhar number, the GeM portal can maintain a single point of contact for each organisation. This makes it easier for the GeM team to communicate with the organisation and resolve any queries or issues promptly."

"Do my secondary users require separate login credentials? Can they access my seller account directly?
","Yes, your secondary users require separate login credentials. They cannot access your seller account directly. 

Each secondary user must have their own unique login credentials, including a username and password. This ensures that each user has their own individual access to the GeM portal and can only view and perform actions that are relevant to their specific role.

Secondary users can only access the GeM portal through their own login credentials. They cannot directly access your seller account or perform any actions on your behalf. This helps to maintain the security and integrity of your seller account and prevents unauthorized access.

If you want to grant secondary users access to your seller account, you must explicitly add them as authorized users. This can be done through the ""Manage Users"" section of the GeM portal. Once you have added a secondary user, you can assign them specific roles and permissions, such as the ability to view orders, process payments, or manage products.

By requiring separate login credentials for secondary users and restricting their access to your seller account, GeM helps to ensure the security and confidentiality of your business information."
"Can I assign secondary user access to someone outside my organization like an external agency or freelancer?
","Yes, you can assign secondary user access to someone outside your organization, such as an external agency or freelancer. To do this, you will need to provide the following information:

* The name and email address of the person you want to add as a secondary user.
* The role you want to assign to the secondary user.
* The start and end dates for the secondary user's access.

Once you have provided this information, GeM will send the secondary user an email invitation. The secondary user will need to click on the link in the email to create a GeM account. Once the secondary user has created an account, they will be able to access GeM using the username and password they created.

Secondary users will have access to the same information as primary users, with the exception of sensitive information such as financial data. Secondary users will also be able to place orders on behalf of your organization.

Please note that secondary users are not employees of GeM, and GeM is not responsible for their actions. It is your responsibility to ensure that secondary users are trustworthy and have the necessary knowledge and skills to use GeM properly."
"Is there a limit on the number of secondary users I can add to my seller account?
","Yes, there is a limit on the number of secondary users you can add to your seller account on GeM. As per the GeM guidelines, a seller can have a maximum of 20 secondary users associated with their account. This limit is in place to ensure proper management and control over the account and its activities.

If you need to add more than 20 secondary users, you will need to contact GeM support and request an exception. GeM may grant an exception in certain cases, such as when a large organization has a genuine need for more secondary users.

For any further queries or assistance, please feel free to reach out to GeM's customer support team. They will be happy to help you with your concerns."
"Is any approval required if I want to remove secondary user access that I have granted earlier?

"What kind of profile information is visible to my secondary users when they login? Can they see financial data?
","As a GeM customer service, I would like to inform you that your secondary users' access to profile information is limited based on the permissions you have assigned to them. Here's a breakdown of what they can and cannot see:

1. **Visible Profile Information**:

- Name
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Designation
- Address
- KYC Status

2. **Restricted Profile Information**:

- Password
- Bank Account Details

3. **Financial Data**:

- **Secondary Users:** Secondary users can only view financial data if you have explicitly granted them permission to do so. By default, they will not have access to financial information.

To manage user permissions, follow these steps:

"Can secondary users initiate transactions like making a bid or deal on my behalf? Are there any monetary limits imposed?
","Yes, secondary users can initiate transactions on your behalf, including making bids and deals, as long as they have been granted the necessary permissions within the system. However, there are **monetary limits** imposed on secondary users to ensure that they do not exceed their authorized spending limit. These limits are set based on various factors, such as:

* The overall spending limit assigned to your organization or project.
* The specific permissions and roles assigned to the secondary user.
* The category of goods or services being procured.

When a secondary user initiates a transaction that exceeds their authorized spending limit, the system will prompt them to seek approval from an authorized approver within your organization. This approval process helps prevent unauthorized spending and maintains control over the procurement process.

The exact monetary limits imposed on secondary users may vary depending on your organization's policies and the specific procurement guidelines in place. You can contact your GeM account manager or refer to the GeM platform's documentation to learn more about the monetary limits applicable to secondary users in your organization.

Here are some additional points to consider regarding secondary users and their transaction limits:

* Secondary users can only initiate transactions within the scope of their assigned roles and permissions. For example, if a secondary user is only authorized to make purchases up to a certain amount, they cannot initiate a transaction that exceeds that limit, even if the overall spending limit for your organization is higher.
* Monetary limits can be adjusted or revised based on changes in your organization's requirements or changes in the roles and responsibilities of secondary users. You can request such adjustments through the GeM platform or by contacting your account manager.
* Compliance with monetary limits is crucial to ensure proper financial management and prevent overspending. Regularly monitoring and reviewing secondary users' transactions can help identify any potential issues related to spending limits and ensure adherence to your organization's procurement policies."
Are communications from GeM sent only to me (primary user) or do secondary users also receive them?,"Communications from GeM are sent to both the primary user as well as secondary users. All users with login access to the GeM portal receive email and SMS notifications regarding various activities and updates. These notifications include order status updates, bid/tender announcements, invoice details, and general platform updates.

This ensures that all users are kept informed about relevant information related to their roles and responsibilities on GeM. By providing real-time updates and alerts to both primary and secondary users, GeM aims to enhance transparency, streamline communication, and facilitate efficient collaboration among buyers and sellers on the platform."
