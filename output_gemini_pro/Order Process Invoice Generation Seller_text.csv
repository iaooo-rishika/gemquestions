How soon after delivery can I update delivery date and proof on GeM?,"As a GeM customer service, I would like to inform you that you cannot update the delivery date and proof on GeM after the delivery has occurred. GeM is a Government e-Marketplace where buyers and sellers interact electronically. Once an order is placed on GeM, the buyer is required to acknowledge the receipt of goods within 15 days of delivery. If there is any dispute regarding the delivery, the buyer can raise a complaint within 15 days of delivery. After this period, the delivery date and proof cannot be updated on GeM."
