"What are the steps I need to follow to resubmit my request for brand or OEM approval if it was previously rejected or I received a notification asking for more information?
","Sure, if your request for brand or OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) approval was previously rejected on GeM or if you're asked for more information, follow these steps:

1. First, log into your GeM Seller account.
2. Navigate to the section where you have submitted your initial request. This would typically be in the 'My Products' section.
3. Look for the 'Brand Approval' or 'OEM Approval' tab, depending on your initial request.
4. Within this tab, find your initial request and review the rejection reasons or the request for additional information.
5. Amend your initial request based on the feedback you've received. This could involve adding more detailed information, clarifying some points, or perhaps providing additional evidence or documentation.
6. Once you've made the necessary changes, resubmit your request. 

Please ensure that all information is accurate and relevant before submitting your request. The GeM Approval team will review your revised request and if satisfied, will approve your request. If additional issues are found, they may either reject it or request more information again."
"Where can I view the status of my brand or OEM approval requests and any notifications from the approval team?
","You can check the status of your OEM or brand approval requests on the GeM portal itself. After logging into your seller account, navigate to 'My Dashboard'. Then, push the 'Brand & OEM Approvals' tab located under 'My Account' - 'Manage Catalog'.

In the 'Manage Approvals' section, you can view all the pending, approved, and rejected requests. Notifications related to approval status will also be displayed in this section. For any further notification, make sure to keep an eye on the provided email address since the approval team typically communicates via email as well."
"If my request is pending with the admin, what are the possible actions they can take (e.g. reject, request more details, approve)?
","The admin can take the following actions on your pending request:

1. Approve: The admin might give your request the green light if all the required details are found to be in order and fulfilling GeMâ€™s terms & conditions.

2. Reject: If your request does not meet the standards set by GeM or required details are missing, the admin can reject your request outright.

3. Request More Details: If your request appears to be mostly in order, but certain specifics are lacking or unclear, the admin might ask you to provide more details. This is done to obtain a clearer understanding of your request before making a decision.

4. Put On Hold: In certain instances, if the admin needs more time to study certain aspects of your request, they may put your request on hold.

To know the status of your request, kindly log in to your account and check the status or you can contact GeM support for more information."
"If the admin requests additional details, where can I update those details and resubmit my request?
","If the admin requests additional details, you can update those details and resubmit your request through the GeM portal. Login to your seller account on the portal. Navigate to the 'My Profile' section where you can update your details. Once the updates have been made, you can resubmit your request. Do ensure all the information is accurate and complies with the requirements stipulated by the GeM."
"How many attempts do I have to resubmit my request with additional details before it is permanently rejected?
","The GeM typically allows up to 3 attempts for resubmitting the request with additional details. If the request is not approved after these attempts, it may be permanently rejected. Please remember, however, guidelines may vary and it is advised to contact the relevant GeM support for specific situations."
"Is there any indicator of my remaining attempt count so I know if I'm close to a permanent rejection?
","No, the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) does not provide a counter for the number of attempts made by a seller. However, it is important to ensure that any application for selling on the GeM platform is made carefully, ensuring that all required documentation is correct and fully provided. If a registration attempt fails, the reason for the failure will be conveyed, which should then be addressed in the next attempt. Permanent ban from the platform typically happens on serious grounds like fraudulent activities or severe non-compliance."
"If my request for a new brand is rejected, can I request approval for the same brand again in the future?
","Yes, if your initial request for a new brand registration was rejected, you can apply again. However, please ensure that you address the issues that led to the initial rejection and meet all the necessary criteria before reapplying. Make sure to provide all the required details and documents for the successful acceptance of your brand in Government e-Marketplace."
"If my new brand request is rejected, can another seller request approval for that same brand?
","Yes, if your new brand request has been rejected, another seller can certainly request approval for the same brand on GeM. The approval or rejection of brand requests is based on specific criteria and requirements set by GeM and does not restrict other sellers from making a similar request. However, it is important for the seller to ensure that they meet all the requirements to increase their chances of approval."
"If my original brand request was rejected and I try applying for OEM status of that same rejected brand, will I be allowed to proceed?
","As a GeM customer service bot, I can tell you that if your Original Brand Manufacturer (OBM) application was rejected, you may not be eligible to enroll as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the same brand. The rejections generally imply unmet requirements or non-compliance. It's recommended to understand the reasons for your previous rejection and rectify the issues before applying again. However, guidelines and policies can vary, so refer to the GeM portal's specific terms and conditions or contact their support for detailed information."
"What should I do if the system does not allow me to proceed with an OEM request for a previously rejected brand?
","If you are facing issues while trying to proceed with an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) request for a previously rejected brand, you should first carefully review why the brand was rejected earlier. Once you understand and resolve those issues, attempt to register the brand again.

If the system still doesn't allow you do this, it's best to contact the GeM support system:

1. You can call the GeM Support team within operational hours (8 AM to 8 PM).
2. Alternatively, you can raise a ticket through the ""Get Help"" button available on the GeM portal.

It's also important to provide them with all the details including any error messages you are getting to expedite the resolution process."
"If my brand approval request meets all the criteria, is there still a chance it may be rejected or are approvals guaranteed if requirements are met?
","While meeting all the criteria significantly increases the chances of your brand approval request being accepted, there is always a chance of rejection due to various reasons like incomplete or incorrect information etc. Approvals are not strictly guaranteed even if all requirements are met, as every request is subject to review & approval by the relevant authorities in Government e-Marketplace. However, if a request is rejected, an explanation or a reason is typically provided."
"Is there an appeals process if I feel my brand or OEM request was unjustly rejected?
","Yes, there is an appeal process if brand or OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) request was unjustly rejected. You can re-apply after modifying the reasons of rejection stated by GeM. In case if you still face any issue, you can reach out to GeM Support Team through the 'Contact Us' link available on the GeM portal. The team will guide you through the process and clarify any issue that led to the rejection."
"Do certain categories of products have a higher bar or different criteria for getting brand approvals?
","Yes, different categories of products may indeed have different criteria for brand approvals. These differences may depend on factors such as product safety and compliance, quality standards, industry regulations, etc. Manufacturers and sellers are advised to familiarize themselves with these specific criteria by going through the guidelines, rules and regulations issued by GeM and the respective category's guidelines. For any specific details or assistance, sellers can also reach out to GeM Customer Support."
"Does my past performance as a seller or number of successful transactions impact the likelihood my future brand requests will get approved?
","No, your past performance or number of successful transactions do not impact the approval of your future brand requests on GeM. The approval of brands on GeM is based on the legitimacy and relevance of the products you wish to sell. It is advised that you keep your documentation updated and complete the required procedures for your brand approval. GeM does not base its decisions on past performances or successful transactions."
"Is there a service standard or SLA on how soon I can expect to get a decision on my brand or OEM approval request after submitting?
","Yes, there's a defined service level agreement (SLA) for brand and OEM approval requests. After you have submitted your request and provided all necessary documents, the Authorities process your application. Generally, the response is provided within 10 working days. However, it may stretch longer if any discrepancies or issues are found in your submitted documents or the request itself. Please ensure that you've provided all details accurately and presented all the necessary documents to avert any delays."
"Can I speak to or request a manual review by someone on the brand approval team if my case requires more nuanced evaluation?
","As an AI, I don't have the ability to set up live conversations. However, if you feel your case requires more nuanced evaluation, you can raise your concerns by contact the GeM support team through the 'Contact Us' section on the Government e-Marketplace portal. Depending on your case specifics, it will be escalated to the appropriate department including the brand approval team if necessary. You can describe your issue or case in detail when you contact them. They have dedicated personnel who will take necessary action according to your case requirements."
"For OEM requests tied to an approved brand, do I need to resubmit brand approval docs or just OEM-specific docs?
","For Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) requests tied to an already approved brand, you don't need to resubmit the brand-related documents. You just need to provide the documents that specifically prove your status as an OEM of the approved brand. These documents will serve as proof of your association with the approved brand."
"If there are multiple pending requests for the same brand, could you fulfill a competitor's request before mine?
","As a chat bot, I don't have control over the fulfillment of requests. However, GeM operates on transparency and equality. Your request would be processed on the basis of first-come-first-serve principle, measures of quality, and compliance with requirements. GeM doesn't prioritize on the basis of competition. It would be best to check with the GeM Customer Service for specific queries regarding your request."
"If I have an approved brand but later lose OEM status for that brand, can I apply again for OEM or will it be permanently blocked?","If you lose OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) status for a brand that is already approved, you will not be able to sell under that brand on GeM until you regain the OEM status. However, this does not permanently block you from applying as an OEM for other brands or the same brand in the future, once the conditions for OEM are fulfilled again. Please note, it is important to keep all your documents and statuses up-to-date to prevent any interruption in your selling activities on Government e-Marketplace (GeM)."
