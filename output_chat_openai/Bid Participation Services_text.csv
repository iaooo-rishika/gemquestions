"How do I find bids I'm eligible for or interested in participating in? Is there a way to get notifications or search for relevant bids?
","Yes, once you are registered as a seller on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), you can search for relevant bids using the 'Bids' option in your GeM dashboard. You can filter the bids based on various criteria such as product categories, bid value, bid submission end date, etc. to find the ones you're eligible for and are interested in.

In terms of notifications, GeM provides automatic notifications for bids that match your product categories. You will receive these notifications via email provided you have opted-in for email updates during the registration process or in your profile settings. Remember to check your spam folder if you are not receiving these emails. 

It's also recommended that you regularly check the website for any new updates or bids."
"What are the different types of bids on GeM and how do they work? For example, what's the difference between a regular bid and a custom bid for services?
","In Government e-Marketplace (GeM), there are primarily two types of bids namely Direct Purchase and Bidding/Reverse Auction.

Direct Purchase: Here, government buyers can directly buy the common user goods and services upto INR 50000.

Bidding/Reverse Auction: In this category, if the cost is more than INR 50000 then the government buyers have to use Bidding and Reverse Auction method to award contracts to the sellers.

Normal Bid and Custom Bid (Direct Bid) are sub-categories under Bidding/Reverse Auction. The major difference between them is as follows:

- Normal Bid: For products, Normal bid can be created based on a product (from the marketplace) or based on a category by specifying own terms and conditions. For services, Normal bid can be created based on a service (from the marketplace) by changing scope of work, timeline and specifying own terms and conditions.

- Custom Bid (Direct Bid): Also known as Direct Bid, here bid is created by choosing a seller of preference based on unique requirements. The terms and conditions, as well as pricing, are negotiated directly with the seller. The Direct Bid is especially useful when dealing with proprietary articles, high-value items and specialized services.

Remember, every bid should comply with the guidelines and terms and conditions provided by GeM."
"For a custom bid for services, it mentions I have to provide the total cost for the contract duration. How do I estimate that if the details are not clear?
","When estimating the total cost for the contract duration, consider all potential costs that go into providing the service. These can include man-hour rates, materials, equipment usage, and other operating expenses. If the details provided on the portal are not clear, you have the right to seek clarification from the buyer through the 'Ask Question' option in each bid. If you are unable to get detailed clarity, itâ€™s recommended to keep your costs slightly flexible to cover any unforeseen costs. It is also wise to consider market rates to ensure your bid is competitive. 

Remember, each bid in GeM is unique and should be handled with clear insight into the detailed requirements of the buyer. Please read all the documents related to the bid to understand what would be necessary to fulfill the contract. Some contracts might require additional costs for transportation, installation, taxes and any potential overtime or extra materials not initially specified. 

However, if you still find difficulty in making an appropriate estimation, you can consider seeking assistance from industry experts or professionals who are well versed in contract bidding."
"Where can I see the technical specifications and requirements before submitting my bid? I want to make sure I can meet all the criteria.
","You can find the detailed technical specifications and requirements for each item in the bidding document available on the GeM portal. Before submitting your bid, it is crucial that you go through the listed parameters thoroughly to ensure that you can fulfill all the criteria. This will aid you in providing appropriate services or products meeting the standards specified by the buyer. The bidding document will contain all the necessary details, terms, and conditions related to the bid."
"If I want to apply for MSE purchase preference, what documents do I need to provide for verification?

"The estimated price shown seems lower than what I can offer the service for. How is the estimated price calculated? Can I still submit a higher price bid?
","The estimated price displayed on the GeM portal is generally calculated based on the historical data of purchases made in the last two years for similar products or services. It is only an indicative price, and it does not limit you to bid at that price. 

As a seller, you can absolutely submit a higher price bid. The price quoted by you should be reasonable and justifiable considering the quality and other specifications of your product or service. Please note, the decision of procurement by buyers will also involve factors like price competitiveness, product quality, supplier ratings, etc.

It's also important that you ensure your products or services are competitive and meet the quality standards asked for by the buyer. Also, if you're continually unable to compete due to price, it may be worth evaluating your costs for potential reductions, enhancing the quality to justify the price, or targeting a different market segment."
