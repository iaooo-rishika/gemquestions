"I don't have a PAN card. What other IDs can I use to register as a seller?
","As per GeM's registration requirements, having a PAN card is obligatory for registering as a seller. Other documents like GSTIN, Aadhaar, bank account details, email id, mobile number etc. are also required. Without your PAN (Permanent Account Number), the system won't let you proceed with the registration process. Therefore, obtaining a PAN card is imperative."
"I entered the wrong PAN details by mistake when registering. How can I correct this?
","I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused. Unfortunately, you cannot modify the PAN after registration as it gets mapped to your unique ID. In this situation, I recommend you kindly get in touch with our service team via our helpline (1800-419-3436/1800-102-3436) or email (helpdesk-gem@gem.gov.in) for further assistance. They may guide you through the process of deactivating the incorrect registration and creating a new one with the correct details."
"My PAN verification failed even though I entered the right PAN. What should I do?
","If you have entered the correct PAN and it's still failing verification, you might want to try the following steps:

1. Double-check your PAN: Please ensure you have entered it correctly and that the information on your PAN card matches with the information you have provided.

2. Verify your details: The PAN card details should match with the details of the business such as the name, date of incorporation/DOB.

3. Secondary Verification: You can also verify your PAN details on the Income Tax Department’s online portal. If the PAN card details are not reflecting properly on their platform, you may need to approach them to resolve the issue.

4. Contact Support: If the problem persist you can raise a ticket on GeM portal's helpdesk or contact GeM Customer Support at helpdesk-gem@gov.in with the necessary details and they will assist you further.

Please remember that the verification process can take a few days so it's recommended to wait for a while before reaching out to the Support team."
