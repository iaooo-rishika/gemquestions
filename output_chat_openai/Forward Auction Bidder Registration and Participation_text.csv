"How do I register as a buyer on GeM to participate in forward auctions?
","I'm sorry for the confusion, but as a seller, you will not be able to register as a buyer on Government e-Marketplace (GeM). The two roles have separate processes. 

To clarify, registration on GeM as a buyer is limited to government officials, Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), Autonomous bodies and Local bodies only who are allowed to buy products and services from the portal. 

However, if you are interested in becoming a seller on GeM, the process is quite straightforward. A seller must first register themselves, provide necessary details like industry, category, and sub-category of goods and services they wish to sell, then upload products or services accordingly.

For participating in forward auctions, you would need to be already registered as a seller. An eligible seller can participate in the auction, bid for the auction and if successful, can sell the products to the buyer. 

Please let me know if you have more questions about becoming a seller on GeM."
"What are the steps to login and access the forward auction module after registering as a buyer?
","As an AI customer service chatbot, I currently possess information related to selling on GeM. It seems like you are asking for steps related to buying on GeM. Nonetheless, in general, here are the typical steps to access any module after registering:

1. Go to the GeM website.
2. Click on 'Sign In' at the top right corner of the webpage.
3. Enter your username or email and password, then click 'Sign in'.
4. If you're a buyer accessing the forward auction module, you need to look for 'Auction' or similar options in the dashboard or navigation menu.

Please reach out to GeM customer support or refer to their website/users' guide for buyer-specific instructions. But if you have any more questions related to selling on GeM, feel free to ask."
"How do I create a category and set auction parameters like start price, increments, time extension etc in the forward auction module?
","As a customer service chat bot, I must inform you that sellers on GeM (Government e-Marketplace) do not manage auction or category creation parameters as these are managed by the entity or the organization which is looking to procure the items. 

The individual government departments, organizations, and public sector units (PSUs) float the bid or auction requests on the portal, specifying their requirements, quantities, delivery locations, etc. 

Sellers are expected to respond to these bids or auctions by updating their quotations or bid prices for the products and services they offer. 

If you are registered as a seller on GeM, you are not permitted to create categories or set auction parameters such as start price, increments, and time extensions. You can however set your product's selling price, product description, and other details to provide enough information to the buyers.

On the buyer's side, the creation of bidding or Reverse Auction, inviting sellers, defining parameters such as start price, increments, auto extension, bid start time, bid end time is done during bid creation itself. 

I hope this helps. Should you need further assistance, feel free to ask."
"What is the process for new buyer registration on the auction website?
","To register as a buyer on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), you need to follow the steps below:

1. Visit the official GeM Website.

Remember, accurate and up-to-date organization details are critical as they will be used for all future transactions and communications. Any wrong information can result in the rejection of your request."
"How do I view auction details and EMD requirements before registering for an auction?
","Before registering for an auction on GeM, it's important to view the auction details and Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) requirements. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Visit the GeM portal and go to the homepage.
2. Browse through the list of available auctions or use the search function to find specific auctions.

4. The auction details page will display all pertinent information including the auction's start and end dates, product/service details, quantity, minimum order value, bid increment amount, etc.
5. The EMD requirements will also be listed in this section. EMD is a kind of security deposit that sellers pay to the buyer, which can be forfeited if they fail to meet their obligations.

Remember, each auction might have different EMD requirements based on their criteria. Always check and ensure you meet these requirements before registering for an auction. If you're unable to view these details or encounter any issues navigating the website, feel free to reach out to the GeM support for assistance."
"What are the steps to submit my EMD details and get it approved by the department?
","The Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is a mandated requirement by buyers during the bidding/auction process on GeM. Here are the steps to submit your EMD details:

1. On winning any bid/auction on GeM, you'll be mandated to submit your EMD details. 

2. Log in to your seller dashboard.

3. From the dashboard, navigate to “My Bids” and then “Auctions (Participated/ Invited)”. Here, you will find a list of all auctions you have participated in.

4. Click on the 'EMD Payable' link for the specific bid where you need to submit the EMD details.

5. In the EMD submission screen, enter all the necessary details of the transaction like payment mode, Bank Guarantee (BG) number, issuing bank, BG issue date, BG expiry date, and BG amount.

6. Upload the scanned copy of your Bank Guarantee form and provide the EMD amount.

7. Click on the 'Submit' button. 

Once you've submitted your EMD details, the concerned department/buyer will verify them. If the department/buyer finds the details to be as per the bid/auction requirements, they'll approve your EMD.

Please know that the approval is subject to the correctness and validity of the submitted details. Make sure to fill in accurate BG and EMD details to avoid any delays or rejections. 

This is based on general procedures and may vary a bit based on specific user interface and updates on GeM portal. Make sure to follow the instructions and prompts on your seller dashboard."
"What happens if my EMD submission gets rejected? Can I resubmit it before the due date?
","Yes, if your Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) submission gets rejected, you can certainly resubmit it before the due date. Please ensure that you follow the correct procedure and submit all the necessary details correctly to avoid rejection in the future. In case you need assistance, please feel free to reach out for support."
"What are the terms and conditions I need to accept before entering the bidding hall?
","As a seller on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), you need to accept the following terms and conditions before bidding:

1. You agree that you will provide accurate and complete information about your products or services. Misrepresentation or incorrect information can lead to disqualification or blacklisting.

2. You will comply with all the guidelines, instructions, terms, and conditions provided by GeM at all stages of the bidding process. Non-compliance can lead to disqualification.

3. You shouldn't engage in any form of corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive, or obstructive practices.

9. You should comply with all the laws and regulations of the Government of India, including but not limited to, rules regarding taxes, duties, levies and charges, environmental management and labor laws.

Please note that these terms and conditions are to give you a general idea. Specific terms and conditions may vary based on the category of product or service you are bidding for. Therefore it is advised to read all the conditions carefully at the time of bidding."
"Can I bid on multiple properties in the same auction event? What are the conditions for that?
","As a customer service bot for Government e-Marketplace (GeM), I can tell you that GeM primarily deals with the auction and procurement of goods and services for government organizations. Regarding bidding on properties, you may be talking about a different platform or auction scenario. 

On the GeM, as a seller, you can certainly participate in multiple bids for different goods and services as long as you meet the eligibility criteria, possess all the required documents and assets, and no policy restrictions apply to your business entity. Each auction or bid would be individual and would require you to adhere to its specific terms and conditions. 

For more information on a specific scenario, I'd recommend checking the specific terms and conditions or reaching out to the auction or bid coordinator directly."
"How does the auto-bidding feature work? How do I enable it?
","The auto-bidding feature on Government e-Marketplace (GeM) can benefit sellers considerably. Once enabled, the feature will automatically place bids on your behalf based on the pre-set minimum increment whenever you are outbid, until your maximum limit. This way, it can help you save time by not requiring your constant attention and possible intervention in case there's a bidding war.

To enable auto-bidding, follow these steps:

1. During the bidding process for a product, you will see an option to activate auto-bidding.
2. When activating this feature, you will be asked to set an upper limit for your bid. This is the highest amount you are willing to pay for the product.
3. Once you set this limit, the auto-bidding feature will keep bidding on your behalf without any intervention from your side.

However, you should carefully set your maximum limit for a realistic value, keeping in mind the product and its market value. Also, ensure you monitor the process occasionally to maintain control of the auction.

Please note that the auto-bidding feature might not be available for all types of auctions in GeM. Check with the auction rules or reach out to the GeM support team to confirm its usage."
"How can I switch to bidding for another property during live auction? What are the conditions for switching?
","As an AI chatbot, I don't have real-time access to the system. However, generally, the switching of bids during a live auction on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) can depend on the specific rules of the given auction. 

Typically, bidders must adhere to the following key points:

1. You cannot switch or transfer bids in the middle of an auction. You are allowed to bid on any property you are eligible for as long as the auction is still open.

2. Once you've placed a bid for a particular property, it's committed to that property. If you want to bid on another property, you would need to do this separately.

3. A bidder entering an auction agrees to the terms and conditions of that specific auction. Therefore, it's important for bidders to understand and accept these terms before participating.

Please, check auction-specific regulations or directly get in touch with the auction's organizer for more specific information. Alternatively, you can also check the ""Help & Support"" section on the GeM portal."
"Where can I check the bid history and download the intimation letter after the auction?

Remember to provide them with all the information regarding the issue, including screenshots, if possible, to expedite the resolution process."
"I already have a buyer account on GeM. Do I need to register separately for forward auctions?
","Yes, you would need to register separately to participate in Forward Auction. The forward auction is a sales business model where sellers and buyers participate for the purpose of selling goods and services. A buyer account does not grant access to the entity wishing to sell its goods or services. Register separately to be a part of the forward auction process."
"What documents do I need to provide for buyer registration on the auction portal?
","To register as a seller on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), you will need to provide the following documents:

1. Self-certified copy of the Registration Certificate of the entity, like GSTIN document.
2. PAN Card.
3. MSME/ Startup/ Make in India certificates (If applicable).
4. Bank Account details.
5. Income Tax Returns of at least the last 1 year.

"Is there a fee or subscription charges for accessing the forward auction module?
","No, there are no charges or subscription fees for accessing the forward auction module on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) platform. GeM provides free and open access to all its modules for sellers."
"Can I see the list of upcoming forward auctions on GeM? Where can I find it?
","As a government e-marketplace (GeM) support system, I would like to inform you that information regarding upcoming forward auctions might not be directly accessible on the platform due to the eMarketplace's dynamic nature.

However, you can regularly log into your seller account on GeM to check for any new bidding or auction opportunities which might come up. Also, ensure to update your notification settings so that you receive alerts about upcoming opportunities directly to your linked email or mobile number.

Remember, the information will only be available when government departments, organizations, or PSUs list items/services for auction. Keeping your product catalog up-to-date will also increase the chances of notification about relevant auctions."
"Is there an option to set alerts for auctions in my interested categories?
","Yes, GeM provides the feature to set notifications or alerts for your interested categories. As a seller, you can opt-in for notifications from your dashboard under preferences/settings. These notifications would give you updates about new auctions, bids, tenders, etc., in your chosen categories. This feature may vary as per the GeM's user interface updates. If you require additional help, consider reaching out directly to GeM customer support."
"Can I customize my dashboard or create shortcuts for frequent auction actions?
","As of the current functionalities of the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), there are no options to customize the dashboard or to create shortcuts for frequent auction actions. However, the platform is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. If you need assistance with a particular action or process, feel free to ask."
"Is there an option for proxy bidding in forward auctions? How does it work?
","No, there is currently no proxy bidding function in the GeM Forward Auction. In a GeM Forward Auction, registered sellers on the Government e-Marketplace have to actively participate in the bidding process. They need to keep track of the highest bid and place their own bid manually before the auction period closes. Proxy bidding, which allows a system to automatically bid on behalf of a participant up to a maximum amount, is not a feature available at present in GeM Forward Auction. The competition in this scenario is explicit, immediate, and must be directly engaged by the participants."
"What happens if there is a tie between multiple highest bidders?
","In the scenario of a tie between the highest bidders in a GeM auction, the system will automatically select the one who placed the highest bid first. Timing is a crucial factor in the auction process, and the system distinguishes between the same bids based on time of submission. The bidder who achieves the highest bid first gets preference."
"How soon after the auction can I make the payment against my winning bid?
","As a GeM seller, you don't typically participate in auctions or make payments for winning bids. You list your products or services and then buyers (government departments or agencies) purchase from you. Payments are normally made to you once the buyer acknowledges the receipt and satisfactory quality of your goods/services. Please ensure your bank details are correct on your GeM profile for smooth transactions."
"What are the different modes of payment available for auction settlement?
","On Government e-Marketplace (GeM), all settlements are made through electronic payment modes. Here are the different modes of payment available for auction settlement:

1. Online Payments: This includes Net Banking, Debit Cards, Credit Cards, and UPI. 

2. NEFT/RTGS: National Electronic Funds Transfer or Real Time Gross Settlement can be used for larger transactions.

3. Direct Debit: This refers to the withdrawal of funds directly from your account as per the mandate.

4. Cash Management Services: These are unique banking solutions for faster and efficient collection and payment of funds.

Sometimes, the available modes of payment may also depend on the rules and regulations stipulated by the respective banks. Please note that all payments are to be made in Indian Rupees only."
