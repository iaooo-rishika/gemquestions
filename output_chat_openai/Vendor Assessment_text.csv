"I have filled details as a reseller in the VA form. But some of my product categories also include some manufacturing. How do I reflect this hybrid business nature in the process?
","You have the option to register as both a reseller and a manufacturer on GeM. While filling up the registration form, indicate that you are both a manufacturer and a reseller. Ensure you provide the Manufacturing Enterprise (ME)/Micro Small Medium Enterprise (MSME) number for your manufactured products. For the products that you intend to resell, you can skip the ME/MSME number. 

Remember, you must upload valid documents for both the categories. For your manufacturing business, the Udyog Aadhar Memorandum (UAM)/MSME certificate is important. For reselling, you need to provide the Authorized Dealer Certificate (ADC), if applicable. 

Once you have filled up the forms and uploaded necessary documents, your account would then be reviewed by the GeM team. If everything is found in order, your products would be listed under the appropriate categories, allowing you to operate as both a manufacturer and reseller."
Is there an online tracking system to check the exact stage my physical verification is at by the independent assessment agency?,"Yes, there is an online tracking system. Sellers can track the status of their physical verification from the sellers' dashboard on the GeM portal. All stages of verification are updated in real-time, including the assignment of an assessment agency, scheduling of visits, visit status, and report submission. This ensures transparency and keeps the sellers informed about the progress of their verification process."
