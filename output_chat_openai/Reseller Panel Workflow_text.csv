","As a seller on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), you can sell products in various categories that are enlisted on the portal. This includes items like electronics, computers, machinery, medical supplies, vehicles, textiles, and many more.

However, as per the guidelines provided, sellers may resell only certain types of products defined by the GeM. Products categories available for reselling are divided into four quadrants. Quadrant-2 products are typically 'Low Volume-High Value' goods that are less frequently purchased but have a higher unit price.

Labelling a product as Quadrant-2 doesn't automatically make it available for reselling. The portal may or may not permit reselling based on the product, industry, and government need. It's also important to note that the categorization may change over time based on the government requirements.

I would recommend regularly reviewing the list of product categories for resellers on GeM's official website or contacting GeM directly to remain updated on any changes to what can be resold on the platform."
