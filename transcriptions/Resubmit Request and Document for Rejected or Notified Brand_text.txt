 Namaskar, welcome to Government E marketplace. In this module, we will take a look at the steps to be followed by a seller to resubmit their request for brand or OEM approval. Any time a brand or OEM request is missing any document or needs more information from the seller. The brand approval team replies with a notification explaining the next steps to get the approval. The seller can view the details from the catalog page by clicking on the more link and then on the brand or OEM requests link. A seller can request for adding a new brand and OEM from their OEM panel by searching a category and then creating a request or else they can choose an existing brand and apply for OEM dashboard. The status of the OEM request can be seen under the request status. In the highlighted case, you can see the request is pending with the admin. The admin can either reject the request or approve the request or even request for any additional details. The seller can click on the view button and then update the details as per the request. The seller will get a maximum of three attempts to resubmit the request. It may be noted that even on the third attempt, if they are unable to provide the correct documents, then their request will be considered rejected. In order to avoid permanent rejection, they can view the attempt count before submitting the documents in a message that pops up at the bottom of the page which mentions the count of the attempt. If a seller's request for a new brand is rejected, then they cannot request for the same brand again. But another seller may request for the approval of that brand. In spite of this, if the seller tries to apply for OEM status of the same brand, they will not be allowed by the system to proceed further. Thank you.
