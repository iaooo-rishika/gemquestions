 Hello, welcome to Government E Marketplace. This functionality has been introduced to enable you to quickly create variant of existing catalogs, where all specifications accept a few have the same values. You can specify the catalog of which you need to make a variant. Make changes in the required specifications and publish. Fill in the catalog ID of an existing catalog from the same category in the field. This tooltip mentions how you can easily find the catalog ID of an existing catalog. On clicking Submit, all the specifications from the existing catalog will be copied to the new catalog, golden and non-golden parameters. A dialog box prompting for your consent to clone the specifications will pop up. Click on Submit to proceed. Clone, you can now proceed to add the stock details and make changes in the relevant specifications. Once done, you can publish the catalog. Note, after cloning the specifications, you need to ensure that changes are made to at least one specification. Or the system will not allow you to publish a duplicate catalog. If you need to sell an existing product, you should use the catalog pair functionality instead. Thank you.
