 Hello, welcome to Government E marketplace. This module explains how you can discontinue a product or catalog from a seller's account. Note, the discontinue product functionality is only available for catalogs aligned under quadrants 2 and 3. Case 1, discontinued product in Q2 quadrant categories. OEM catalog in Q2 category. Only the OEM will be able to see the discontinue catalog tab. The OEM can click on the tab to discontinue the catalog. All the paired catalogs will also be delisted from the market. On clicking the discontinue catalog tab shown earlier, a message box will pop up. It would ask for your confirmation to proceed. Click here to proceed. On confirming, the request gets completed. If the same catalog is uploaded by a reseller, it will also get discontinued. The reseller would be able to see the status under discontinued tab. Case 2, discontinued product in Q3 quadrant categories. In Q3, discontinuing a catalog would only discontinue the seller's own offering and will not affect any other paired seller's offerings. Select the check box, saying, I would like to discontinue selling this product on gem. Click here to proceed. Product discontinued by OEM will reflect as discontinued in the OEM's dashboard. But it will remain active in the resellers dashboard. Thank you.
