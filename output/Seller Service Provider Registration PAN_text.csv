"I don't have a PAN card. What other IDs can I use to register as a seller?
","As a GeM customer service, I understand your query about alternative identification documents for seller registration in the absence of a PAN card. Here are the options available for you:

1. **Aadhaar Card:** You can utilize your Aadhaar card as a valid identity proof for seller registration on GeM. It is a widely accepted document that serves as a proof of identity and address in India.

2. **Voter ID Card:** Another acceptable form of identification is your Voter ID card. It is an official document issued by the Election Commission of India and serves as a proof of identity and address.

3. **Passport:** If you possess a valid passport, you can use it as an identity proof for GeM seller registration. It is a globally recognized document that verifies your identity and nationality.

4. **Driving License:** Your Driving License issued by the Regional Transport Office (RTO) can also be used as an identity proof for GeM registration. It serves as a proof of identity and address.

5. **Shop & Establishment Certificate:** In case you have a physical store or business, you can provide a copy of your Shop and Establishment Certificate as proof of identity. It is issued by the local authorities and confirms the existence of your business.

Please note that these documents should be self-attested copies and should be uploaded along with your registration application on the GeM portal. Additionally, you may need to provide other relevant documents such as bank account details, GST certificate (if applicable), and business address proof.

I hope this information helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team for assistance."
