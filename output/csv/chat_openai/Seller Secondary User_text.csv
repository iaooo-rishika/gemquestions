"What is GeM and how does it work?
","Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is a platform developed by the Government of India that serves as a central point for procurement of goods and services required by Central and State Government departments, organizations, and Public Sector Units. It simplifies the process of procurement while ensuring transparency and maintaining a high level of efficiency.

How GeM works:

1. **Registration**: As a seller, you first need to register on the GeM platform by providing all the requisite details.

2. **Listing of Products**: Once registered, you can list your goods or services. The platform allows you to put up multiple goods and services for sale.

3. **Buying Process**: Government departments, PSUs, and Autonomous bodies can then access these listings. They can buy the products or services either through direct purchase or bidding or reverse auction.

4. **Payment**: Once a transaction is successful, the payment is processed and directly transferred to the seller's account.

5. **Performance Rating**: Both buyers and sellers are rated on their performance. This rating can influence future transactions and offers a level of assurance for buyers.

GeM provides an open and transparent system for sellers to reach out to the government, making it simpler and more efficient than traditional methods. It also offers tools for easy tracking of payments and real-time tracking of orders and supplies."

"What roles and permissions can I assign to a secondary user?

3. Bid participation: The user can participate in bids but cannot create or edit products.

"Why does the secondary user need to register with PAN or Aadhar based on what I registered with?
","As a secondary user on the GeM platform, it is important to register with either PAN or Aadhaar, following the primary user's method, in order to maintain consistency and ensure secure verification of user credentials. It aids in avoiding confusion and uncertainties about user identities. This is necessary to ensure the safety and security of all transactions made on the GeM platform. It also assists in maintaining transparency and authenticity between buyers and sellers. Having two different identities for a single account can lead to complications in transactions."

2. Email Address: OTP might also be sent to the registered email address for additional verification.
   
3. Personal and Business Details: Depending on the platform's requirements, sellers may need to also verify their identity using personal details (like name, date of birth) or business details (like the name of the business, GST number).

"Do my secondary users require separate login credentials? Can they access my seller account directly?
","Yes, secondary users do require separate login credentials. The primary user or admin can create sub-users under their main user account and assign them different roles and responsibilities. These secondary users cannot access your seller account directly; rather, they will have their own access limitations set by the admin. This feature ensures the security of your account while permitting operations to go smoothly throughout your team."
"Can I assign secondary user access to someone outside my organization like an external agency or freelancer?
","No, as per GeM's policy, the secondary user access can only be given to users who are part of your organization. Sharing of credentials with external entities is strictly prohibited and can lead to suspension of the concerned seller account on GeM."
"Is there a limit on the number of secondary users I can add to my seller account?

Please navigate to the user management section in your GeM seller dashboard to make any necessary changes."
"What kind of profile information is visible to my secondary users when they login? Can they see financial data?
","The visibility of information to secondary users depends on the permissions granted to them. While they can view basic information related to the business such as business details, products, and orders, access to financial data is generally restricted to maintain privacy and security. This information is mostly accessible only to the primary user or users with specific permissions. It's recommended to set permissions carefully to ensure sensitive data is handled properly."
"Can secondary users initiate transactions like making a bid or deal on my behalf? Are there any monetary limits imposed?
","Yes, secondary users can initiate transactions like making a bid or deal on your behalf. However, the primary user (usually the business owner or primary administrator) has the ability to define the monetary limits and responsibilities for each secondary user, if any, during the process of creating secondary users. This is to ensure the smooth functioning of the business while also adding a layer of control and security. Please make sure to set the limits and responsibilities as per your business requirements."
Are communications from GeM sent only to me (primary user) or do secondary users also receive them?,Communications from GeM are sent to both primary and secondary users associated with the seller account.
