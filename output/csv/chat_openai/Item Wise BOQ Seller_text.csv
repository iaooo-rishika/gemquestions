"What is item-wise evaluation and group-wise evaluation in BOQ bids?
","In the context of GeM (Government e-Marketplace), Bid evaluation methods are used to assess the bids submitted by sellers and to determine the most cost-effective options. The two bid evaluation methods used on GeM are Item-wise Evaluation and Group-wise Evaluation:

1. **Item-wise Evaluation**: In this method, each line item in the Bid of Quantities (BOQ) is evaluated separately. Therefore, a buyer may end up procuring different line items from different sellers. This method offers flexibility to the buyer in selecting the most advantageous bid for each item.

2. **Group-wise Evaluation**: This method involves evaluating the total cost of all line items in the BOQ bid. With this method, the buyer procures all items from a single supplier, who is deemed to offer the best value for the entire package of goods or services. 

Note: The choice between these methods is generally contained in the bid documents and depends upon the procurement needs and discretion of the buyer."
"What is the minimum value for creating a BOQ bid?
","The minimum value for creating a Bid/Offer or BOQ (Bill of Quantity) bid on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is Rs. 25,000. Please ensure to follow all guidelines provided for creating a BOQ bid."
"For item-wise evaluation, what does the buyer need to specify?
","For item-wise evaluation on GeM, the buyer needs to specify:

1. The criteria of evaluation: These can include factors like quality, cost, delivery time, past performance of sellers, etc.
2. The weightage assigned to each criteria: Criteria that are more important to the buyer should be assigned a greater weightage.
3. The scoring model: This will define how each vendor's offer is scored against the evaluation criteria.
4. Relative importance of price and non-price factors: In some cases, non-price factors such as quality and delivery time may be more important than price. The buyer needs to indicate this clearly.
 
Remember that the evaluation criteria should be related to the item being purchased and must comply with the rules and regulations of the GeM."
"For group-wise evaluation, what does the buyer need to specify?
","For group-wise evaluation on GeM, the buyer needs to specify items/products in groups. They should clarify that the evaluation will be performed on a group of items rather than individually. Features such as grouping similar items together, marking primary and optional items, and setting a maximum and minimum quantity, among other things, will have to be specified. It's also important that the buyer details the evaluation formula he intends to utilize."
"Can a buyer give a title to a BOQ bid? If yes, why is this useful?
","Yes, a buyer can provide a title to a BOQ (Bill Of Quantities) bid while creating a bid in the GeM platform. Providing a relevant and descriptive title to a BOQ bid is beneficial because it allows the seller to easily understand the specific requirements and the nature of products or services that are needed. This ultimately results in better response from sellers who satisfy those particular specifications, leading to a more efficient and successful bidding process."
"What can a buyer choose to do after technical evaluation of bids?
","After the technical evaluation of bids, the buyer has several options. They can:

1. Choose to accept the most appropriate bid based on the evaluation.
2. Open the price bids of the technically qualified sellers for financial evaluation.
3. Cancel the bid if it does not meet all the requirements.
4. If needed, the buyer has a right to negotiate with the bidder for better terms such as quality, price, delivery, servicing etc.
5. In the case of a tie in terms of price amongst technically qualified bids, the buyer may ask the tied bidders to submit revised commercial bids for deciding the successful bidder. 

It's important to note that the final decision is made taking into account both technical and financial suitability."

"How does the price matching work in BOQ bids on GeM?
","The Price Matching feature in the Bill of Quantity (BOQ) bids on GeM works by comparing the lowest quoted price for a specific item with the quote from other sellers. Whenever a buyer generates a bid or bid invitation, every seller gets a chance to quote their prices.

The system will then automatically match and compare the offered prices for the products/services by each seller. The seller who gives the lowest quote for that product or service wins the bid.

However, it is noteworthy that the buyer may not always select the lowest quoted price but can also factor in product quality, seller credibility, past performance on the platform, and other relevant factors when choosing a seller. The key is to strike a balance between competitive pricing and unique value proposition. The decision of the buyer is final in these cases.

Please remember that all bids should be submitted accordingly for transparent and competitive bidding before the Bid Closure Time for the BOQ. Late submissions are generally not considered. 

In all scenarios, it is advised to categorically specify product specifications, terms, and conditions in the BOQ to avoid any potential dispute or confusion in the future."
"Can I provide a discount on my total bid price during the price matching stage?
","No, you cannot provide a discount on your total bid price during the price matching stage. It is required to submit your best competitive prices at the time of initial bid itself on GeM. The price quoted should be inclusive of all taxes and delivery charges. The price matching stage is an opportunity for you to match your prices with L1 (lowest) bid, but you cannot offer an additional discount on your already quoted price."
"How long does it usually take for a BOQ bid evaluation result to be published after bidding closes?
","The Bid Evaluation typically takes about 10 days after the bidding closes. However, the actual duration may slightly vary as per the complexity of the bids received. Please remember to check the status regularly on your GeM portal as notifications are also sent in each step."
"Is there an advantage to submitting my BOQ bid early versus waiting until the last day?
","Early submission of your Bid of Quantity (BOQ) bid on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) indeed benefits you in a number of ways. Most importantly, it helps avoid last minute technical glitches or human errors that may prevent a successful submission. It also gives ample time for rectification if any errors are found by the system in your bid.

Furthermore, occasionally, buyers may start the technical evaluation of bids as and when they are submitted instead of waiting until the deadline. In this case, early submissions may have an advantage. However, buyers still have to wait until the closing time to evaluate all bids.

Therefore, while there is no explicit advantage in the evaluation process of submitting your bid early, it helps to ensure smooth and error-free submission."
"What are some common reasons bids get disqualified during technical evaluation?
","There are several reasons why a bid may get disqualified during the technical evaluation stage on GeM:

1. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions: Sellers must strictly comply with all the terms and conditions specified in the tender document. Failing to do so can lead to disqualification.

2. Incorrect or misleading information: If the seller provides incorrect or misleading information about their product or service, their bid can be disqualified.

3. Incomplete information: If the seller has not filled all the required fields or if any mandatory attachments are missing, their bid might be rejected.

4. Lack of technical ability: If the seller cannot meet the technical requirements or specifications set out in the bid, it may lead to disqualification.

5. No Compliance Certificate: If the seller doesn't provide the necessary compliance certificates for their products or services, their bid can be disqualified.

6. Delayed response: If the seller does not respond to queries or does not provide additional information as per deadline set by the buyer, this delay can lead to disqualification.

7. Pricing issues: If the prices quoted are extraordinarily high or unrealistic, it can lead to the bid getting disqualified.

Please make sure to carefully read the bid requirements and conditions to avoid disqualification."
"If my bid gets disqualified, can I speak to someone to understand why?
","As a chatbot, I can tell you that in Government e-Marketplace (GeM), reasons for disqualification are usually mentioned in the bid result. However, for a more detailed explanation or to discuss any specific issue, the GeM Support Team is available. You can contact them through the Help Desk. Note that as the entire process is transparent and regulated, the reasons for disqualification are objective and based on the terms and conditions of the bid."
How soon after bid submission can I expect payments if my bid wins?,"While GeM itself doesn't facilitate direct payments, once your bid has been selected as successful by the buyer (government department or agency), they would be raising a purchase order. The payment terms and schedule are usually outlined in the payment terms by the buyer. Typically, government departments should make payment within 10 days of receipt of goods/services or the acceptance of the contract. However, this might vary based on specific contract terms or government policies. Please make sure you thoroughly review the payment terms in any contract or tender documentation."
