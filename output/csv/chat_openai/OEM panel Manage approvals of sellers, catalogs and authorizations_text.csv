It means both the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) product and its reseller's product can be listed for the same item. These are usually linked so that buyers can compare and make their purchase decisions.

2. Discontinue: The discontinue option allows OEMs or sellers to remove their product listing from GeM. This can be done if the product is not being manufactured anymore, or if there is a change in product specifications or features, or any other reasons.

"What criteria does an OEM use to approve or reject my catalog? Is there a standard checklist I can view?
","The approval or rejection of your catalog by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) on Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is based on various factors that ensure the quality and suitability of your products. Here are some key criteria that are generally considered:

Using a transparent, high-quality approach in your business transactions with OEMs should enhance your chances of getting approval."
"If an OEM rejects my catalog, is there an appeals process I can follow before reuploading?
","Yes, there is an appeal process if the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) rejects your catalog. This process is called the ""Resubmission process"". Once your catalog has been rejected, you should receive specific reasons for the rejection. 

You will need to correct these reasons first before you can reupload your catalog again for the approval. With the correct changes and improvement based on the feedback given, you should be able to successfully re-upload the catalog again for the review.

In case any issue persists, you can always reach out to the GeM support team for further assistance or guidance."
"Are OEMs required to provide a detailed reason when discontinuing or rejecting my catalog?
","No, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are not mandated by GeM to provide detailed reasons for discontinuing or rejecting your catalog. However, the most common reasons for such actions often relate to non-compliance with GeM's oem marketplace guidelines or requirements. If your catalog has been discontinued or rejected, it would be prudent to review and ensure that your product listings are in conformity with all guidelines provided by GeM."
"How frequently are OEMs required to review pending catalog approval requests? Is there an SLA defined?
","Yes. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are required to review and approve or reject the product catalog within 5 working days after it has been uploaded by a seller. If a seller's catalog is not approved or rejected by the OEM within these 5 working days, the catalog will be considered approved by default. Therefore, there is indeed a Service Level Agreement (SLA) defined for review of pending catalog approval requests."
"Can I submit multiple catalog approval requests under different categories for the same OEM?
","Yes, as a seller on GeM, you have the ability to submit multiple catalog approval requests for different products under different categories for the same Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). However, each submitted product for approval must meet the guidelines outlined by GeM and adhere to the specific category requirements."
"Can I use the same authorization code for multiple categories when uploading catalogs?
","No, you cannot use the same authorization code for multiple categories. An authorization code in GeM is generated for a specific Product and Seller ID. Hence, each product category requires a unique authorization code for catalog upload. Please generate a separate code for each category you are selling under."
"Is the OEM panel accessible on mobile apps or just the website?
","The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is accessible both via the website and its mobile application for convenience. However, for comprehensive features and detailed activities like seller dashboard or OEM panel functionalities, it is generally recommended to use the website version. It may be best to refer to the latest version of the app or the official GeM website for any recent updates."
"What kind of catalog changes require me to do a fresh upload versus minor update?
","A fresh upload is required when there are significant changes in the product specifications or the product itself. This includes changing the product category, product SKU, brand or manufacturer, or model. Major changes in price can also necessitate a fresh upload. 

On the other hand, minor updates can be done for small changes like updating product descriptions, images, minor updates in price, stock levels, or minor variations in product attributes. These updates do not change the nature or category of the product. Thus, a minor update is less substantial than a fresh upload. Please remember to follow the guidelines provided on the GeM portal for any changes in your catalog."
"Can OEMs deactivate my seller account directly or do they need to go through GeM for that?
","No, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) cannot directly deactivate your seller account on GeM. All deactivations or suspensions of seller accounts are managed by the GeM administration following a systematic review process. The OEMs can contact GeM administration if they have any complaints or issues, but they cannot directly deactivate any seller's account."
