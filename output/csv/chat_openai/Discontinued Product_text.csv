"How do I discontinue a product catalog if I am an OEM seller in a Q2 category?
","If you are an OEM seller in a Q2 category and wish to discontinue a product catalog, follow these steps:

1. Login to your OEM Seller account on the GeM portal.
2. Navigate to the “My Products” section.
3. Search for your product catalog that you want to discontinue.
4. Click on the ""Action"" button next to that catalog.
5. Then, click on ""Discontinue Product"".
6. A pop-up will confirm if you are sure you want to discontinue the product. Click ""Yes"".

Remember, once you have discontinued a catalog, you can't reactivate it. If you want to sell the same product again, you will have to create a new catalog."
"If I am a reseller and the OEM discontinues a product catalog, will my catalog also get discontinued automatically?
","Yes, if you are a reseller on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) and the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) discontinues a product catalog, your product catalog for that specific product will also get discontinued automatically. This is because your product listing is linked to the OEM's product listing. Therefore, any changes made by the OEM will reflect on your listing. If the OEM discontinues the product, it will no longer be available from your catalog as well."
"If I am in a Q3 category, when I discontinue a product catalog, will it affect the listings of other paired sellers?
","If you discontinue a product catalog as a Q3 category seller on GeM, it should not affect the listings of other paired sellers. Each seller's product catalogue and listings are individual and independent of each other. However, if there are changes or updates in the same product catalogue shared by multiple sellers, it might require them to update their own listings based on the changes made."
"If I am a reseller and the OEM discontinues a product, will it show as discontinued in my seller dashboard?
","As a chat bot for GeM, I can tell you that generally the products do not automatically show as discontinued in the seller dashboard if the OEM discontinues a product. It is the seller's responsibility to keep track of the status of their products. If an OEM discontinues a product, the seller will need to manually update that on their dashboard to reflect current availability and status. Always ensure that your product listings are up-to-date to maintain transparency and trust with your buyers."
"What is the process to discontinue a product catalog as an OEM seller in a Q2 category?
","To discontinue a product catalog as an OEM seller in a Q2 category on GeM, you should follow these steps:

1. Log into your seller dashboard on the GeM portal.

2. Find the option of 'My Catalogs' in the sidebar menu and click on it.

3. Search or scroll down to identify the product catalog you wish to discontinue.

4. Once located, click onto the individual catalog. You'll see an option marked 'Discontinue', 'Deactivate' or similar.

5. Click on that option and then, if asked, confirm your selection.

Please note that once a catalog is discontinued, the associated products will no longer be available for sale on GeM. Navigate the process carefully to avoid discontinuing a catalog by mistake and double-check before finalising your selection. 

Keep in mind that the exact steps may vary marginally depending on specific site updates or changes.

If you need further assistance, consider contacting the GeM Support Team for more detailed information."
"What tab do I need to click to initiate discontinuing a product as an OEM seller?
","As a customer service bot specifically designed for the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), it's crucial to guide you properly. As an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) seller, if you want to discontinue a product, you need to navigate to the 'Product Management' tab. From there, you should be able to control all aspects of your products, including discontinuation. However, details may vary based on changes on the platform. Always ensure you follow the terms and regulations stipulated by GeM when making such changes."
"For Q2 categories, do I need to discontinue each paired reseller's catalog separately or will it happen automatically?
","As a seller, for Q2 categories, you have to individually discontinue the reseller's catalogue for each product you wish to stop selling. The system will not automatically discontinue the product listings for you. Please ensure proper updation of catalogue details on the GeM portal to avoid any inconsistencies."
"What happens when I confirm discontinuing a product catalog in a Q2 category?
","Once you confirm the action of discontinuing a product catalog in a Q2 category on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), the listed product will no longer be available for purchase by government buyers on the platform. Please note that discontinuation is different from product deletion. Discontinued products can be re-activated, but deleted products are permanently removed. Also, ensure that you fulfill any existing orders or contracts for that product even after discontinuing it."
"As a reseller, where can I see if one of my products was discontinued by the OEM?
","As a chatbot for GeM, I can share that the platform itself does not provide a tool or section where sellers can check if their products were discontinued by Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). It would be best practice for you to frequently check with the OEMs or their official websites to verify the status of the products. If a product has been discontinued, you should also update this information on your GeM portal to provide most accurate information to the buyers."
"For Q3 categories, can I selectively discontinue my product without affecting other sellers?
","Yes, as a seller, you have control over the products you list. If you intend to discontinue a specific product from the Q3 categories, you can simply remove it from your listed products without it affecting other sellers. However, it's worth noting that once a product is removed, the offers associated with it will also be removed and buyers would not be able to place new orders for the product. Furthermore, you must fulfill all active orders for your discontinued product. Please make sure to read the guidelines or consult with GeM's support system to fully understand the implications of discontinuing a product."
"What do I need to do to discontinue a product in a Q3 category? Just select a checkbox?
","Discontinuing a product listed under a Q3 category in GeM requires you to follow the appropriate steps through your Seller's dashboard. However, it's not simply a matter of checking a box. Here are the general steps:

1. Log into your Seller Dashboard on the GeM portal.

2. Navigate to the 'My Products' section where you will see a list of all your products.

3. Locate the product you wish to discontinue. 

4. You will then see the status or action section alongside every product, where you can make modifications to your product.

5. You should find an option to deactivate or stop selling the product. Select the option.

6. You'll likely be asked to confirm your decision. This will discontinue your product from the Marketplace.

Remember to save any changes before you exit the page. Also, it's essential to know the implications of discontinuing a product like how it can affect your seller status, the effect on your customers, etc. If you run into any issues in the process, please reach out for further assistance."
"If a product is discontinued by OEM in Q3 category, will it still show as active for resellers?
","If a product is discontinued by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), it will not show as active for resellers on GeM. This is because the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is committed to providing the most current and high-quality products available. Once a product is discontinued by its OEM, it implies that the product may no longer have the necessary after-sales support in terms of parts, updates, warranty, etc. Therefore, it is considered not suitable for sale on the platform. Resellers are strongly advised to update their product listings regularly and discontinue any product that is no longer manufactured or supported by the OEM."
"If I upload a new catalog with a discontinued product SKU, will it automatically be discontinued or can I relist it?
","Once a product SKU has been discontinued, it can't be automatically enabled if you upload a new catalog. If you want to relist the product, you need to create a new SKU and upload it. Please ensure the product complies with all guidelines and conditions of GeM before you create a new SKU."
"As an OEM, if I discontinue a product now, can I undo it later or reactivate the listing?
","Yes, as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), if you discontinue a product, you retain the ability to reactivate the listing at a later date. However, please note that the process of reactivating a listing and making it live again on the Government e-Marketplace may require re-validation or quality checks, depending on the category and type of the product."
"I'm a reseller who carries products from multiple OEMs. If one OEM discontinues a product, does that affect the same product I source from another OEM?
","No, if one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) discontinues a product, it does not necessarily affect the same product you source from another OEM. You're free to sell the same product sourced from different manufacturers. However, you must ensure that the product listings are distinct and it's clearly mentioned that they are sourced from different OEMs. In case of any product discontinuation, you need to update the product availability status on the GeM portal. If you face any issues, you can contact the GeM support for further assistance."
"Are there any fees or penalties for frequently discontinuing and relisting product catalogs as an OEM?
","As a customer service bot, I don't have real-time access to all specific policies, but generally, Government e-Marketplace (GeM) encourages sellers to maintain continuity and stability in their product listings to ensure a reliable marketplace for buyers.

However, there might not be any explicit fees or penalties for frequently discontinuing and relisting product catalogs. Please note that constantly doing so might impact the trust with potential customers negatively.

I highly recommend you refer to the GeM official guidelines or contact the GeM support directly for the most accurate information on this matter."
"As a reseller, will I get any notification if an OEM discontinues a product I'm carrying so I can update my listings?
","As an AI chatbot, I can clarify that the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) platform doesn't directly provide notifications if an OEM discontinues a product. However, it is the responsibility of the seller to maintain up-to-date inventory information. Sellers need to maintain a close relationship with their OEMs to stay informed about any changes in the product line-up. Regularly updating your offerings on GeM ensures buyers have accurate information and smooth transactions."
"When a product gets discontinued, is there a way for buyers to still view the old product page for reference or is it deleted?
","When a product is discontinued or no longer available for sale on Government e-Marketplace (GeM), the product listing is removed and it is not available for viewing. This is done to ensure that all the listings on the platform are relevant and up-to-date. However, if you're a seller and wish to maintain records for reference, I recommend archiving the details of your product listings offline on your own system."
"For how long do discontinued product catalogs remain in my seller dashboard before being removed entirely?
","Discontinued products' catalogs remain visible in the seller's dashboard for a period of 15 days. After this, they are permanently removed from the dashboard. However, the actual period might vary slightly depending on the system's process. It's advised to keep a personal record of your products for future reference."
"If I discontinue a product as OEM, could another seller apply and list the same discontinued SKU again?
","As an AI developed specifically for Government e-Marketplace (GeM), I can tell you that the process depends on the rules and policies of GeM. If you as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) have discontinued a specific SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), normally another seller won't be able to list the identical SKU unless they are officially recognized as the new manufacturer or have rights to sell the product. However, to get the most accurate answer, I recommend directly contacting GeM support or referring to the regulations provided on the GeM platform."
Is there a limit to how many times I can discontinue and relist a product catalog within a certain time period?,"No, there isn't a specified limit on how many times you can discontinue and relist a product catalog within a certain time period on GeM. However, it is highly recommended to manage your listings properly to ensure accurate information is provided to buyers. Continual discontinuing and relisting may lead to confusion or mistrust among potential buyers."
