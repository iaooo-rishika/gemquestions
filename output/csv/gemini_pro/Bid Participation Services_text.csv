"What are the different types of bids on GeM and how do they work? For example, what's the difference between a regular bid and a custom bid for services?
","There are three main types of bids on GeM:

1. **Regular Bid:**

   - In a regular bid, buyers (government departments, organizations, and PSUs) create a bid document specifying their requirements, including product specifications, delivery terms, and payment terms.
   - Suppliers submit their bids online, offering to supply the goods or services at a specific price and within a specified timeframe.
   - The buyer evaluates the bids based on parameters such as price, quality, delivery timeline, and supplier reputation.
   - The contract is awarded to the supplier with the most competitive bid.


2. **Reverse Auction Bid:**

   - In a reverse auction bid, the buyer specifies the product or service requirements, but instead of suppliers submitting bids, they participate in an online bidding process.
   - Suppliers start by quoting their highest price, and the price gradually decreases over multiple rounds of bidding.
   - The supplier with the lowest final bid wins the contract.


3. **Custom Bid for Services:**

   - Custom bids are used for specialized services or complex requirements that cannot be easily categorized into a regular or reverse auction bid.
   - The buyer creates a bid document outlining the specific requirements, including the scope of work, deliverables, timelines, and evaluation criteria.
   - Suppliers submit their proposals, which are evaluated by the buyer based on various factors, such as technical expertise, experience, and proposed methodology.
   - The contract is awarded to the supplier with the most suitable proposal.

**Differences between Regular Bid and Custom Bid for Services:**

| Feature | Regular Bid | Custom Bid for Services |
|---|---|---|
| Type of Requirement | Standard products or services | Specialized or complex services |
| Bid Process | Suppliers submit bids based on buyer's specifications | Suppliers submit proposals based on buyer's specific requirements |
