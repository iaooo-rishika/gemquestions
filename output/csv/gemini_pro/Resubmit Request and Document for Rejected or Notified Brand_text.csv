","Yes, your past performance as a seller and the number of successful transactions you have completed on the GeM platform can positively impact the likelihood of your future brand requests getting approved. Here's how your past performance is taken into consideration:

1. **Seller Rating:** GeM maintains a seller rating system that evaluates your performance as a seller on the platform.
