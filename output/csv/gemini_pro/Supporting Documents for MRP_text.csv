"Is there a size limit per individual uploaded document? Or does the 1 MB limit apply only to the total size of all uploaded files?

"For multi-page PDF catalogue documents, do you recommend splitting into separate PDFs for each product? Or can a single PDF contain multiple products?
","For multi-page PDF catalogue documents, we recommend splitting them into separate PDFs for each product. There are several benefits to doing this:

1. **Improved User Experience:** Splitting the catalogue into multiple PDFs makes it easier for users to navigate and find the specific product they are looking for. They can easily download or print just the PDF for the product they are interested in, rather than having to download or print the entire catalogue.

2. **Faster Loading Times:** A single PDF containing multiple products can be quite large in size, which can result in longer loading times. Splitting the catalogue into smaller PDFs helps reduce loading times, providing a better user experience.

3. **Easier File Management:** Separate PDFs for each product make it easier to manage and organize the catalogue. You can easily add, remove, or update individual product PDFs without affecting the entire catalogue.

4. **Improved Accessibility:** Splitting the catalogue into multiple PDFs makes it more accessible for users with disabilities. For example, users with visual impairments may find it easier to navigate and read individual product PDFs than a single large PDF.


While it is possible to have a single PDF containing multiple products, we generally recommend splitting the catalogue into separate PDFs for each product for the reasons mentioned above.

**However, there may be some cases where it is more appropriate to have a single PDF containing multiple products, such as:**

1. **When the products are closely related:** If the products in the catalogue are closely related and are typically purchased together, it may make sense to keep them in a single PDF. For example, you might have a single PDF for all the products in a particular product line.

2. **When the catalogue is relatively small:** If the catalogue is relatively small and contains only a few products, it may be more convenient to have a single PDF.

3. **When the products are not frequently updated:** If the products in the catalogue are not frequently updated, it may be more efficient to have a single PDF. This way, you only need to update the PDF once, rather than updating multiple PDFs for each product.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to split the catalogue into separate PDFs or to have a single PDF containing multiple products depends on the specific needs and requirements of your business and your customers."
"Some of my product invoices contain pricing info which is confidential. Can I redact or obscure the pricing but still use these for MRP validation?
","Yes, you can redact or obscure the pricing information on your product invoices while still using them for MRP validation. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Identify the Pricing Information:**
- Examine your product invoices and identify the areas that contain pricing information, such as unit prices, discounts, and total amounts.

2. **Select a Redaction Method:**
- Choose an appropriate method to redact or obscure the pricing information. This can include:
  - **Blacking Out:** Use a black marker or digital editing software to black out the pricing information.
  - **Whiteout:** Apply whiteout correction fluid or use a digital whiteout tool to cover the pricing information.
  - **Blurring:** Use image editing software to blur the pricing information, making it illegible.
  - **Pixelation:** Convert the pricing information into a pixelated image, obscuring its readability.

3. **Apply Redaction:**
- Carefully apply the selected redaction method to obscure the pricing information on your product invoices. Ensure that the redaction is complete and does not leave any visible traces of the original pricing.

4. **Create Redacted Copies:**
- Make copies of the redacted product invoices for MRP validation purposes. These copies should contain all the necessary information for MRP validation, excluding the pricing information.

5. **Maintain Confidentiality:**
- Store and handle the redacted product invoices securely to maintain the confidentiality of the pricing information. Limit access to authorized personnel only.

6. **Document the Redaction:**
- Keep a record of the redaction process, including the methods used, the date of redaction, and the individuals involved. This documentation serves as an audit trail and demonstrates compliance with confidentiality requirements.

7. **Communicate with Suppliers:**
- Inform your suppliers about the redaction of pricing information on their invoices. Assure them that this practice is solely for MRP validation purposes and does not affect the accuracy or validity of the invoices.

By following these steps, you can redact or obscure pricing information on your product invoices while still using them effectively for MRP validation, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive business information."
