"What is the Sahai platform and what is its purpose?
","The Sahai platform is an online dispute resolution (ODR) platform developed by the Government e-Marketplace (GeM). Its purpose is to provide a user-friendly, secure, and efficient mechanism for resolving disputes arising from transactions conducted on the GeM platform.

Key Features of the Sahai Platform:

1. Online Dispute Resolution: The Sahai platform allows buyers and sellers on GeM to resolve their disputes online without having to resort to traditional legal proceedings. This saves time, resources, and reduces the overall cost associated with dispute resolution.

2. Neutrality and Impartiality: The Sahai platform operates independently of GeM, ensuring neutrality and impartiality in resolving disputes. This instills confidence among users that their disputes will be handled fairly and justly.

3. Streamlined Process: The Sahai platform features a streamlined dispute resolution process, making it easy for users to file their cases, submit evidence, and communicate with each other throughout the process. This simplifies the dispute resolution process and reduces the complexities often associated with traditional legal proceedings.

4. Mediation and Arbitration: The Sahai platform offers two dispute resolution mechanisms: mediation and arbitration. Mediation involves a neutral third party facilitating discussions between the disputing parties to help them reach a mutually agreeable settlement. Arbitration involves a neutral third party (arbitrator) hearing both parties' arguments and rendering a binding decision.

5. Qualified Mediators and Arbitrators: The Sahai platform has a panel of qualified and experienced mediators and arbitrators who handle disputes on the platform. These individuals possess expertise in various fields, ensuring they can effectively resolve disputes in a fair and timely manner.

6. Confidentiality: The Sahai platform maintains the confidentiality of all disputes and related information throughout the dispute resolution process. This protects the privacy of the parties involved and encourages open and honest communication during the proceedings.

7. Cost-Effective: The Sahai platform offers dispute resolution services at a significantly lower cost compared to traditional legal proceedings. This makes it more accessible for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and individuals who may not have the resources for extensive legal battles.

In summary, the Sahai platform is an innovative ODR platform designed to facilitate the resolution of disputes arising from transactions on the GeM platform. It provides a user-friendly, efficient, and cost-effective mechanism for buyers and sellers to resolve their disputes online, ensuring fairness, impartiality, and confidentiality throughout the process."
