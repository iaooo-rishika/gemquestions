"If the consigny rejects some quantity at the time of CRAC generation, what options do I have as a seller to create a supplementary invoice?
","As a seller on GeM, you have the following options to create a supplementary invoice if the consignee rejects some quantity at the time of CRAC generation:

1. **Issue a Credit Note:**

   - Create a credit note for the rejected quantity.
   - Share the credit note with the consignee through GeM.
   - Once the credit note is accepted by the consignee, you can issue a supplementary invoice for the remaining accepted quantity.

   - Share the revised invoice with the consignee through GeM.
   - Ensure that the consignee accepts the revised invoice before generating the CRAC.

3. **Create a Separate Supplementary Invoice:**

   - In case the rejected quantity is significant and requires a separate invoice, you can create a supplementary invoice for the accepted quantity.
   - Mention the original invoice number and date in the supplementary invoice for reference.
   - Share the supplementary invoice with the consignee through GeM.
   - Generate the CRAC based on the original invoice and supplementary invoice.

It is important to communicate with the consignee and keep them updated throughout the process to ensure a smooth resolution and timely CRAC generation."
"What is the time limit within which I need to create the supplementary invoice for the rejected quantity - is it within the delivery period of the contract?
","No, the supplementary invoice for the rejected quantity does not need to be created within the delivery period of the contract. You can create the supplementary invoice anytime after the delivery period has ended. The invoice should be submitted on the GeM portal and should include the following information:

* The contract number
* The purchase order number
* The quantity of items rejected
* The reason for rejection
* The amount of the refund or credit due"
"For the rectification and replacement invoices I create as a seller, will these invoices reference the original invoice number?

When you create a rectification or replacement invoice, you will need to include the following information:

* The original invoice number
* The date of the rectification or replacement invoice
* A description of the rectification or replacement
* The amount of the rectification or replacement

You should also note that rectification and replacement invoices are used for different purposes. Rectification invoices are used to correct errors on the original invoice, while replacement invoices are used to replace the original invoice entirely.

"As a seller, how many times can I declare reshipment for the same shipment or invoice?

1. The original shipment should not have been delivered to the buyer.
2. The reason for reshipment should be valid and acceptable to GeM.
3. The reshipment should be initiated within the specified time frame as per GeM guidelines.

If you need to declare reshipment for the same shipment or invoice more than once, you will need to contact GeM customer support for assistance. They will review your case and determine if an exception can be made."
"Do I as a seller have the option to generate multiple invoices for the same declared reshipment?
","Yes, as a seller on GeM, you have the option to generate multiple invoices for the same declared reshipment. Here's the process:

1. **Create Reshipment:**
   - Initiate a reshipment request from the 'My Orders' section in your seller account.
   - Provide the necessary details, including the original order ID, quantity to be reshipped, and the reason for reshipment.

Remember to follow GeM's policies and guidelines when generating invoices. If you have any further questions or concerns, you can reach out to GeM's customer support for assistance."
"What is the process to generate a replacement invoice if the consigny rejects quantity at the time of PRC generation?
","1. **Confirmation of Rejected Quantity:**

   Ensure that the consignee has formally communicated the rejected quantity in writing, along with supporting documentation such as images or videos.


2. **PRC Generation:**

   Generate a PRC (Provisional Receipt Certificate) for the accepted quantity. The PRC should accurately reflect the quantity received by the consignee.


3. **Rejection Memo to Consignee:**

   Prepare a rejection memo addressed to the consignee, clearly stating the rejected quantity, the reason for rejection, and the date of rejection. This memo should be signed by an authorized representative of the consignee.


4. **Raise a Dispute:**

   Raise a dispute on the GeM portal, providing all relevant details, including the PRC number, order number, supplier details, rejected quantity, reason for rejection, and supporting documentation.


5. **Resolution of Dispute:**

   The GeM portal will review the dispute and facilitate a resolution between the supplier and the consignee. If the supplier is found to be at fault, they may be required to issue a full or partial refund, or to replace the rejected quantity.


6. **Generation of Replacement Invoice:**

   If the dispute is resolved in favor of the consignee, the supplier will be required to issue a replacement invoice for the accepted quantity. The replacement invoice should be uploaded to the GeM portal, and the invoice number should be updated in the PRC.


7. **Payment:**

   Once the replacement invoice is generated and approved, consignee can proceed to make the payment for the accepted quantity.


8. **Closure of Dispute:**

   The dispute will be closed once the payment is successfully processed. Note that the process may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case. It is important to follow the instructions provided by the GeM portal and to communicate effectively with the supplier and the consignee to ensure a timely resolution."
"What do you mean by deemed, auto, PRC and CRAC cases? Why are these invoice types not eligible for supplementary invoice creation?
","* **Deemed Cases:**
    - Deemed cases are invoices where the supplier has not submitted the invoice on the GeM portal within the stipulated time frame (generally 15 days from the date of acceptance of goods or services).
    - In such cases, the system automatically generates a deemed invoice based on the information available in the purchase order and the goods receipt note (GRN).
    - Supplementary invoices cannot be created for deemed cases as the system-generated deemed invoice is considered the final invoice for that transaction.

* **Auto Cases:**
    - Auto cases are invoices where the supplier has submitted the invoice on the GeM portal, but the invoice has been auto-approved by the system without any manual intervention.
    - This typically happens when the invoice amount is within the pre-defined limits set by the buyer organization and the invoice meets all the mandatory requirements.
    - Supplementary invoices cannot be created for auto cases as the system-approved invoice is considered the final invoice for that transaction.

* **PRC Cases:**
    - PRC (Payment Release Certificate) cases are invoices where the payment has been released to the supplier without waiting for the invoice to be submitted on the GeM portal.
    - This is done in cases where the buyer organization has a trust-based relationship with the supplier and is confident that the supplier will submit the invoice later.
    - Supplementary invoices cannot be created for PRC cases as the payment has already been released based on the purchase order and the GRN.

* **CRAC Cases:**
    - CRAC (Centralized Receipt and Accounting Cell) cases are invoices that are routed through a centralized payment processing center before being released to the supplier.
    - This is typically done in large government organizations to ensure proper accounting and control of payments.
    - Supplementary invoices cannot be created for CRAC cases as the payment process is handled by a centralized agency and not by the buyer organization directly."
"You mentioned all replacement invoices would be treated as new invoices - what does this mean in terms of invoice numbers, invoice dates etc?
","When we say that all replacement invoices will be treated as new invoices, it means that:

1. Invoice Numbers: Replacement invoices will have unique invoice numbers. They will not share the same invoice number as the original invoice they are replacing. This is to ensure that each invoice is tracked and accounted for separately.

2. Invoice Dates: Replacement invoices will have their own invoice dates. The invoice date will be the date on which the replacement invoice is issued. This may differ from the date of the original invoice.

3. Invoice Items and Amounts: Replacement invoices will include the same items and amounts as the original invoice they are replacing, unless there are any changes or corrections that need to be made. However, the invoice number and invoice date will be different.

4. Payment Terms: The payment terms on the replacement invoice will be the same as those on the original invoice. This includes the due date, payment methods, and any discounts or penalties that may apply.

5. Impact on Invoice History: Replacement invoices will be added to your invoice history just like any other invoice. This means you can access and view them through your GeM account.

6. Processing and Approval: Replacement invoices will undergo the same processing and approval流程 as new invoices. This includes any necessary reviews or approvals from relevant departments or individuals.

By treating replacement invoices as new invoices, we ensure that they are properly tracked, accounted for, and processed within our system. This helps to maintain transparency, accuracy, and efficiency in our invoice management process."

"If only some items in the original invoice are rejected, can I create a supplementary invoice just for those rejected items rather than the full invoice quantity?

Please note that you can only create a partial supplementary invoice if the supplier has agreed to it."
"Does the supplementary invoice go through the same invoice processing and payment stages as the original invoice?

1. Submission: The supplier submits the supplementary invoice through the GeM portal.

2. Validation: The GeM system validates the invoice for completeness and accuracy.

3. Approval: The invoice is sent to the buyer for approval. The buyer verifies the invoice details and approves it.

"Do I need to wait for approval from GeM before shipping the replaced/rectified quantities to the consignee?
","No, you don't need to wait for approval from GeM before shipping the replaced/rectified quantities to the consignee.

Once the replacement/rectification process is completed, you can directly ship the replaced/rectified quantities to the consignee. However, you must ensure that the following documents are attached with the shipment:

- Copy of the original purchase order
- Copy of the GeM invoice
- Copy of the delivery challan
- Copy of the inspection report
- Any other relevant documents

You should also inform the consignee about the shipment and provide them with the tracking details."
"If there are transportation charges related to reshipping the rectified/replaced quantities, can I include those charges in the supplementary invoice amount?
","Yes, you can include the transportation charges related to reshipping the rectified/replaced quantities in the supplementary invoice amount.

As per the GeM SPV guidelines, the transportation charges incurred for reshipping the rectified/replaced quantities can be claimed as part of the supplementary invoice. This is because these charges are directly related to the rectification or replacement of the defective goods and are necessary for the completion of the contract.

To claim the transportation charges, you will need to provide the following documents along with the supplementary invoice:

* Proof of payment for the transportation charges (such as a copy of the bill of lading or freight invoice)
* A detailed explanation of the transportation charges, including the route taken, the distance traveled, and the mode of transportation used
* A certification from the supplier that the transportation charges are reasonable and necessary

Once the supplementary invoice and supporting documents are submitted, they will be reviewed by the GeM SPV. If the claim is approved, the transportation charges will be reimbursed to you."
"Is the process for creating supplementary invoices any different if I had used e-billing instead of manual billing for the original invoice?
","Yes, the process for creating supplementary invoices differs depending on whether you used e-billing or manual billing for the original invoice.

**For e-billing:**

"If multiple invoices were clubbed under one CRAC earlier, do I need to create separate supplementary invoices for each original invoice with rejected items?
","Yes, if multiple invoices were clubbed under one CRAC earlier, you will need to create separate supplementary invoices for each original invoice with rejected items. This is because the supplementary invoice must be created against the original invoice and not the CRAC. The supplementary invoice should include the following information:

* The original invoice number
* The date of the original invoice
* The amount of the original invoice
* The rejected items
* The reason for rejection
* The amount of the supplementary invoice
* Signature of the authorized official
* Stamp of the Department/Organization

By creating a separate supplementary invoice for each original invoice with rejected items, you can ensure that the supplier is paid for the accepted items and that the rejected items are properly accounted for. This will help to avoid disputes and ensure that both the supplier and the customer are satisfied with the outcome of the transaction.

Here is an additional clarification on the matter:

* If the original invoice had multiple items and some of them were accepted while others were rejected, then you will need to create a supplementary invoice for the rejected items only.
* If all the items in the original invoice were rejected, then you will need to create a supplementary invoice for the entire amount of the original invoice.
* The supplementary invoice should be created within 15 days of receiving the CRAC.
* You can create the supplementary invoice online through the GeM portal.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the rejected items are properly accounted for and that the supplier is paid for the accepted items."
